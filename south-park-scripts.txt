[Kyle's house, day. Stan and Kyle are happily preparing a snowman, which now has twigs, buttons, a hat and scarf. Tweek stands behind Stan holding a carrot.]
Okay, now put on the nose, Tweek. [Tweek moves forward, but then backs up. Stan rises and turns to Tweek]
I can't. [presents the carrot] You do it.
Just stick it on.
But what if I put it in the wrong place?
Just put it between his eyes.
GARH. But what if, while I'm putting on the nose, the snowman comes to life and tries to kill me?
Tweek, when has that ever happened, except for that one time?
Yeah.
[happens by and waves] Hey, fellas.
[flatly] Oh, hey Butters.
How are things... oing with your new best friend?
[walks up to Tweek] Well, Tweek's okay, but he's certainly no Kenny! [takes the carrot from Tweek's hand]
Arrrr!
Yeah, but he's still better than you, Butters.
Yeah.
Well ah, that's good. Good luck being their new friend, Tweek. I hope you'll do better than me. Well, see ya fellas. [takes his leave, screen left. Stan and Kyle resume work on the snowman]
Oh man, that is waaay too much pressure! [Kyle puts the carrot in place]
[off screen. Stan and Kyle look] You guys, you guys! You're not gonna believe it! [excited, he rushes up and stands between then, holding an ad]
Uh oh.
Everything's gonna be okay, you guys! Life isn't so crappy after all!
It's not?
No! I was looking in this magazine, and I found an ad for little ocean creatures that you can buy and raise in your room!
No way.
Look! [the boys draw close. The ad is shown] Sea people. You keep them under a big tank of water and they like, build castles and play basketball and stuff.
Nuh uh.
Yeah! And look! They ride around on turtles and they play games with fish.
No way.
[shows irritation] Okay, Kyle, you're being a Negative Nancy. Stop it. Eh, unless you want everyone to call you Negative Nancy from now on. [turns to Stan and Tweek and continues excitedly] Now, what we need is to all chip in four dollars, and we can have them here tomorrow!
Only sixteen dollars? They can't be cool if they're only sixteen dollars. [Cartman's smile vanishes and he shuts his eyes.]
If Nancy doesn't want to chip in, then it will be $5.35 per person!
Alright, I'll chip in.
Gah! Me too.
[resigned] Ah, alright.
[Butters' house, day. He reaches his room.]
Butters! Don't forget: dinner is in two hours!
[in the doorway] Wokay, mom. Ah I'm just gonna be up here, uh doin' my homework. [he enters and closes the door behind him. His evil face shows] Yes. By day he is mild-mannered, sweet, and innocent Butters BUT... [runs to his closet and opens the sliding door, then steps inside] nobody knows that he actually has a dark underside... [slides the door shut and changes clothes. He slides the door open and comes out dressed as] Professor Chaos! Haha! Time to wreak havoc on the world that shunned me! [runs to his window, opens it, and jumps out. He skulks through the woods nearby with an easel. He reaches a clearing and sets up the easel. General Disarray shows up pulling a wagon of firewood]
Professor Chaos!
Ah, my faithful companion in world destruction, General Disarray.
I have done as you asked and brought the first load of scrap wood.
Excellent, General Disarray! Now we can begin my most horrible evil plan yet to wreak havoc on humanity. [EVIL PLOT #4-B]
What dastardly deed are we doing now?
Simple, my dear general. [flips the page over to show a drawing of the town with a huge shade over the town, held up by a tall pillar] We are going to block out the sun!
[looking at the picture] Oh. [turns around]
Oh yes! I have plotted for weeks, and figured that if we build a huge ...wooden shade eighty feet high, a-and fifty feet wide [a hamster peers from the wood and drops back down again], precisely on this hill, South Park ...will forever be cast in a great shadow.
Oh, awesome!
Soon, all people will have to live like moles! They will love only to remember with sorrow how great the sun used to be! [laughs with evil glee]
Cool. It'll be just like on the Simpsons. [Butters stops laughing and freezes in place]
[tilts his head forward] Huh?
They did that on the Simpsons. I think it was the Mr. Burns character. He tried to block Springfield from the sun.
He did? Hawww, heck. I thought I was bein' original.
So how do we build it?
Aww, I don't wanna do it now [drops his hammer], not if they already did it on the Simpsons. [walks off dejected] I have to think of something else. [they walk through the woods] Uh Goddamnit, how come every time I think of something clever, the Simpsons already did it?
[Cartman's house, night. The living room light is on. Cartman is sleeping, dreaming...]
Sea people... coming in the mail tomorrow... [bubbles appear as Cartman dreams] Yesss... Yeesss...
[The dream sequence]

[shown floating down to the briny deep. Two pairs of sea arms catch him. The sea couple rights him and walk with him in the middle]
Look at me, livin' free
Free and clean amongst the Sea People
[the sea couple and he sail by in a tiny pirate ship. They take him into the castle]
''We look for pirates and search for gold.
Life is an adventure with the Sea People
[A sea man pitches to Cartman, who bats the ball for a run. As a sea family looks on he blows out the candles on a cake.]
They don't ever complain, they don't call me fat.
They don't make me do homework or nothin' like that.
[he rides a sea horse alongside sea people on horseback and grins at the camera]
This is the way life was meant to be. Laughin' and singing,
[Shown walking with the sea couple again.]
Sea people and me.
Sea people and me, you guys.


[The dream ends and the bubbles fade away. Cartman wakes up, smiling]
Woowww. Only three more hours, sea people. [closes his eyes and turns to his left side] Only three hours and you can take me away from this crappy goddamned planet full of hippies. [goes to sleep]
[Cartman's house, day. He's at his desk with the new kit while Stan, Kyle, and Tweek stand behind him. His dressed as a monarch, in suit, crown and cape.]
Okay. I've added the water purifier tablet to the Sea People Kingdom tank. Now it says [slowing down to read] "Step 2. [grabs a small sack] Add the Sea People eggs to the water; you will see sea life spring instantly." [smiles, then remembers something. He turns to face the other boys] Okay, let's just run through this one more time: when the sea people arrive I will welcome them to South Park as Ambassador of Earth. Tweek, you give them the key to the city, and we'll all engage them in simple conversation. We've gotta make sea people feel comfortable, okay? Ready?
Ready. Let's see 'em.
[turns to the tank] Hold the sign up, Kyle! [Kyle picks a sign up off the floor and holds it to his chest] Higher, Kyle! [Kyle raises it higher, in front of his face] Okay. [opens the egg sack and whispers] Here we go. [pours the eggs into the tank and taps the bag for good measure. Kyle moves the sign a bit so he could peek. Cartman grins again in anticipation, but it fades. Kyle lowers the sign to his chest. Cartman looks from various angles, then takes out the magnifying glass for a closer look. Two pale shrimp crawl around in the tank. Kyle drops the sign]
Are they playing basketball? [Cartman picks up the box and looks at the front. A close-up of a sea couple. Cartman looks in the tank and sees just shrimp. He looks displeased, Kyle has the sign in hand again]
What the fuck is this?! [Stan approaches and looks in the tank]
Hey, these are brine shrimp. I used to feed them to my fish.
I got RIPPED OFF! [pounds the desk and sets the box on the floor to his left]
I told you, Cartman.
[approaches Kyle and confronts him] Oh, shut up, Kyle!!! Shut your Goddamned Jew mouth!!! You people are why there's war in the Middle East!!! [moves on to Tweek] And you, Tweek!! Why don't you learn to button your shirt right, for once?! You're as bad as Stan with his stupid girlfriend, always spending time with her!! God, I hate you guys!! [his rant ended, he walks across the room] They were supposed to take me away to their underwater kingdom. They were supposed to take me on adventures of the deep
[shaking] They package brine shrimp and sell them to kids? That's not right, man!
What are we gonna do with them?
[at the window] Who cares?! Throw 'em away!!
[approaches the tank] Hey! Let's pour them in the teacher's coffee tomorrow morning.
Yeah, that'd be funny.
[brightly] Heheh, okay, okay.
[next day, Ms. Choksondik's house. The scene from last episode is carried on here, only zoomed out. The paramedics take Ms Choksondik's corpse into the ambulance as a crowd looks on. The adults murmur amongst themselves. The ambulance pulls away and Cartman pulls the other boys in with some urgency.]
Alright, listen to me! We must take a strict vow of silence!
[blurts out] Jesus Christ, we killed her!
[rushes to Tweek and covers his mouth] Shh! Tweek, shut the hell up!
[Dougie's house. He's doing homework on the living room coffee table when a doorbell rings. He goes to answer it. He opens the door and Butters steps in with something under wraps]
General Disarray, are your parents home?
No.
Ah, I've done it, General Disarray. I've completed my most horrible deed to date.
What?
You know that big statue in the town square of pioneer John Wesley Powell? I snuck over there with a hacksaw and uh, and I cut off his head! [pulls the cover off and laughs maniacally] Hahahahaa, yeah!
Oh, uh...
Hahaha, and they're probably just realizing that now! Quick! We must turn on the news! [turns on the TV]
... but Hillary Clinton's ass just keeps getting bigger. [the image in the small box changes from Hillary to that of the decapitated statue] Also in the news tonight, a vandal has apparently cut off and stolen the head of the Powell statue in the South Park Town Square.
Look! Look! I've made the news! I-I've wreaked havoc!
The head was taken in the early morning hours and the police have no leads.
I finally made the world sorry! I've brought sadness, a-and chaos!
This act, of course, reminded us all of the time that Bart Simpson [a picture of him appears in the box] took the head of the Springfield statue in one of their classic episodes. Here's what some people had to say:
Well, I, I think whoever took the head was... really just doing an homage to the Simpsons. [laughs] Heh, I think it's great.
Yes, it really made me reflect on that episode and laugh.
Well the Simpsons is such a great show, and we need reminders like this to keep us watching.
Oh. Uh-m, son of a bitch.
The police say that instead of looking for the missing head, they'd rather leave it off and be reminded of the Simpsons every day.
Well why didn't you tell me the Simpsons already did that?
You seemed so proud, I didn't wanna bum you out.
[walks away hanging his head] Stupid Simpsons...
[Kyle's house, night. The boys watch TV on the sofa]
Hello there, Phillip. I brought you something
Oh, what is it? [Terrance farts and Phillip comments, but the boys talk over him]
See? We're just watching cartoons, like always. Nothing's changed.
Jesus Christ, she's dead!!
Stop it, Tweek! We're pretending like nothing happened.
Phillip, I think I may have accidentally killed Celine Dion.
[gasps] Killing is never an accident, you dickface! [farts, and the two of them crack up]
Oh jeez, change the channel.
And in other news, still no known cause of death found for elementary school teacher Diane Choksondik. However, doctors say that during the autopsy they did find semen in her stomach. [there's a pause and the boys look aghast]
They found the sea men! It's only a matter of tiime before they find the women, too!
The autopsy is ongoing and cause of death is yet to be determined.
Oh God!
We're dead!
Oh Jesus! [moves off the couch] That's it, man! I want nothing more to do with you guys!
Tweek! Where are you going?
They're gonna find you out! Then when they do I don't wanna be within fifty feet of you! You're gonna fry, man!
Hey, Tweek, you're in this just as much as we are!
What?! I told you NOT to put the sea people in her coffee! I wasn't even there when you did it!
Yeah, but you're our new friend and that makes you cul.. p-piable!
In fact, that makes you the most responsible. Tweek, you might have to take the fall on this one.
Rrrr-hr-hrrr!!!
[Chef's house, night. The boys arrive at his house and ring the bell. He opens the door and sees them]
Oh, welll, hello there, children.
Chef, we did something kind of bad.
We don't know who else to talk to.
Ohh, I'm sure your little cracker problems ain't all that bad. Come on in. [the boys enter and Chef leads them to the sofa] Now, just sit down and take a deep breath and tell ol' Chef what's goin' on.
[pause] We need you to promise not to tell anybody.
Nowww, children, every problem can be worked out. What was it?
We... killed our teacher and they found our seamen in her stomach
...Oh, children, that's a problem we all have to face at one time or another. Here: let me sing you a little song that might cheer you up. Sometimes you kill your teacher and they find your semen in her stomach, and uh Wait! What the what?!
[beat] So what should we do? [Chef thinks, then goes and pushes the sofa towards the door and onto the entry path]
Wow, I guess this really is a big deal.
We've only got one option, you guys. We're gonna have to go to that hospital where they're doing the autopsy and get our seamen back ourselves.
Gnaaahahahah! [pulls on his hair and looks at his fist] I pulled out my hair!
[Dugie's house, night. In the living room Butters begins to pitch ideas.]
Wokay, how about this, Dougie? [backs up to the easel. On it is the schematic to plan #123-D] I-I'm going' to pose as a real-estate agent and con everyone in town into buyin' a monorail. And then skip town with all their money. [Dougie just looks back] No?
...Simpsons did it. The did it in episode 204.
Wokay [flips to the next page to show #124-A], then I'm goin' to start a Web site to spread vicious ru-rumrs about everyone in town! And and then I'll take their-
Simpsons did it!
[flips to plan #129-E] I'll bury a skeleton wearing angel wings so that the townspeople will think a fallen angel has fallen-
Simpsons did it!
[Hell's Pass Hospital, night. Cartman leads the other boys into the coroner's office]
This is it.
Alright, everyone scatter and look for the seamen. Tweek, stay by the door and keep a look out. If you see anybody coming, say the code word: Hammertime.
Hammertime? Can't the code word just be... "lookout"? I won't remember "Hammertime"!
[whispers] Ugh. [then] Just remember the song "Can't Touch This" and you'll remember the code word!
Yeah, stupid.
Oh, God. [the boys split up. Tweek goes to the door ajar and steps out, Kyle to a table to the right, Cartman to a table to the left, Stan to the supply closet. Cartman opens the doors under his table and looks around, then goes to Kyle's table to check out the drawers there.]
[takes a wide covered beaker and look in it] There's nothing here! [puts it back and Stan approaches]
Dude, it's probably in her stomach. [Kyle approaches the corpse in the middle of the room and pulls back the cover. Ms. Choksondik's chest and abdomen have been cut open right down the front]
Is it her?
Yeah, it's Ms. Choksondik alright.
What do we do now?
Just reach in there and get the seamen out of her stomach! [the boys look at him, shocked] Oh, God! You guys are such pussies! [starts digging around in the belly] Hemmm...
[voices are heard; he rushes back in] Erm! Hff. You gu-guys! Ha... Hamme- [covers his mouth] I can't remember uh-the code word!
Do you see the sea people.
No, just a bunch of goo.
[hushed tones. Shadows appear down the hall and move towards the room] You guys! Um, dum dumdumdum, dumdum, dumdum. Can't touch this. Dum dumdumdum, dumdum, dumdum. Can't touch this.
Ms. Choksondik stinks inside. [covers his nose]
Yeah.
[two people come down the hall] ...dumdum, dumdum. Can't touch this. Dum dumdumdum, dumdum, then stop. HAMMERTIME!
Aaah!
Quick. Hide. [the boys disperse. Stan runs to the closet he looked in earlier, Kyle to one on the opposite side, Tweek behind the door]
[outside] Yeah, well, at least we got Shannon Sharp back. [Cartman burrows his way into Ms. Choksondik's corpse]
Alright, let's just leave the semen sample next to the corpse; I wanna run a hair fiber test next. [snips a piece of hair off and turns around. They both walk back out]
Hey, do you smell children?
No, that's not... [voice fades. The doctors leave and the boys come out of their hiding places. Cartman is still in the corpse]
Got it!
Let's go! [He, Kyle, and Tweek head out the door quickly. Cartman pops out of Ms. Choksondik's corpse gasping for air]
[Butters house, later that night. Butters presents plan #127-C]
Bring the World Cup to South Park so the... a huge soccer riot can destroy the-
Simpsons did it! Simpsons did it!
[flips to plan #125-E] Take all the beer cans in South Park and have them shaken up in a huge mixer at the paint store so that-
Episode 9F17 entitled "So It's Come To This!"
[seethes for a few seconds] Fine! Then maybe I'll just forget about destroying the town and just run away and join the circus! [sits down next to Dougie]
...Simpsons did it.
Dwaah!!
[Cartman's house, later. In his room he takes the semen sample and pours it into his tank, tapping the rim of the tank so the semen can start moving. The semen slides into the tank and puts the lid back on]
There. We just put the sea people back in the tank with the others, and nobody will ever know. [looks at his hands] The blood is washed neatly from our hands. [the door opens and Chef enters with a bunch of stuff.]
Alright, children, I got you four tickets to Thailand [in his right hand, with a sports bag] and three hundred dollars cash [inside the suitcase in his left hand]. It's gonna be tough living for a while. You might have to do things for money you never thought of doin' before.
[stopping Chef] It's alright, Chef! We got our sea people out of the teacher's stomach and we put them back in their aquarium!
[confused] ...Wait, what? Sea people?
The sea people that we put in the teacher's coffee.
Uhh, maybe you'd better start from the beginning.
[Forty-three seconds later...]
...and then we put them back in the tank.
[drops the bag, suitcase, and tickets] Oohhh, children, you misunderstood. Sea people is different from se-men.
It is?
Yes! That stuff that was in that vial didn't come from you, it came from someone else. [begins to chuckle] I thought you children took turns rapin' and then murdered the teacher. [laughs]
Well if they found somebody else's sea men in her stomach, maybe they'll find our sea people, too.
Relax, children, junk that's in brine can't kill you. Your teacher must have died from something else.
Oh, really?? [all four boys let out a sigh of relief]
Egh! I'm so relieved. Gaah-ah-ah!
Alright. You children have had a long night. Why don't we all get some rest and on Monday, I'll sing you a song explainin' the difference between semen and sea people. [picks up the stuff. The boys approach] Come on, children. I'll walk you all home. [the boys follow Chef out]
[turns and waves to Cartman] Okay. Goodnight, Cartman. [turns and exits. Kyle follows]
G'night, guys.
I'm so glad we're not murderers. [Cartman closes the door behind them, moves to his bed and talkes off his hat and shoes. He places his hat on a corner of the footboard and hops into bed]
[settling in] Ah, so great that everything is finally back to normal. [dozes off. The camera moves to the tank to look at the tank.]
[South Park, next day. Stan, Kyle, and Tweek stand at the bus station waiting for the bus.]
[rushes up] H'you guys! Come quick! [turns and runs off] You won't believe it!
Oh no, what now? [the boys turn left and follow]
[Cartman's house, later. He leads them to his room, to the tank]
Those sea men from the teacher's stomach somehow combined with the remaining sea people we had left in the tank and, ah, well LOOK! [the other three approach the tank. Cartman picks up the magnifying glass for a closer look]
Whoa. [the close-up reveals a budding civilization with sea people building multi-story apartments and reads. The brine shrimp have begun to morph into sea people. Some of them wear clothes]
Wow. How did that happen?
I've been up for hours doing some calculations, and I've come up with my final theory of composite dynamics. [brings out a small chalkboard with an equation written on it and points to the various parts of the equation] Sea people plus sea men equals sea ciety.
Whoa.
They've already accomplished so much.
They're like, bacteria. Small organisms live much faster lives and do things at a much faster rate.
That's right, Tweek. And if my theory is correct, all we need to get is more of the two reacting agents, and we can really see them flourish. Tweek!
Hr!
You go and send away for more sea people from the magazine ad! Get at least five gallons of them here stat! Stan and Kyle, you go find a bigger fish tank to them all in.
Well what are you gonna do?
Me? [camera closes in on him] I'm gonna go out on the town and find ten gallons of sea men.
[Dougie's room, day. Butters and Dougie are in costume. Between them is a contraption under a white sheet]
I've done it, General Disarray. I've watches all one hundred and thirty-two episodes of the Simpsons, twice. And I've finally come up with something... tha they have never done! Uh, behold! [pulls the sheet off] This device that I have made will take the cherries out of chocolate-covered cherries and replace the inside instead, with two-month-old mayonnaise. [grins] People will think that they are gonna get a bite of a sweet, delicious cherry, but, instead, they'll get a mouth full of yuckies, and sticky mayonnaise. Hey! [begins to cackle. Dougie fiddles with the machine] You've never ...seen this on the Simpsons, right?
No, I think the Simpsons would be more clever than that.
Good! Then l-let us take my machine outside and make society finally pay for sh-shunning us!
[a commercial for Cheesy-Poofs gives way to a Simpsoons commercial] Tonight on the Simpsons: It's a laughorama when Bart builds a machine that takes cherries out of chocolate-covered cherries and replace them instead, with mayonnaise.
Nnno [turns and faces the TV], uh no, no, it can't be.
Uh oh, Simpsons did it! Simpsons did it! [a shot of the TV]
No! No! [begins hallucinating]
[now looking like Bart and no longer in costume] Simpsons did it! Simpsons did it!
Aaaaah!
Don't have a cow, man.
Oh sweet Jesus!
[Sperm Bank of South Park, day. Cartman hums as he approaches the door. He enters and walks down the hall. The tellers follow him with their eyes.]
Can I help you?
Yes, my mommy told me this is where I could find some sea men?
Your... mom told you?
Do you have them or not?
We... sell semen, yes, but not normally to children.
What's your name?
Frances Velman.
Frances, let's talk. I don't want a bunch of bullcrap from you and you don't a bunch of bullcrap from me, right? Where does that get us? Nowhere. The truth is, I'm completely certified to handle sea men, and though I may appear young, I'm one of the leading sea men authorities of the Midwest. Up and comer, you know what I'm saying? I'll have my own business soon and I'll need people to run it. I'm talkin' about you, Frances. And I'm talkin' about a six-figure income. How does that sound? [she looks at him and rises, moving off to her left.]
[goes to a refrigerator and pulls out a sample] Everything we supply here is by a quarter-ounce. [returns to the desk and gives it to Cartman] One donor, certified, on record.
[inspecting the vial] I see, very interesting. [pulls the cap off and pours the semen onto his left hand]
What are you doing?
Takin' a look here. [pulls out a portable microscope and inspects the semen between his left thumb and index finger. He stretches and squishes the semen. Frances looks on puzzled] Seems like quality stuff you got here, Frances. Yeah, good texture, nice consistency. Sea men must be alive and healthy in there. I'll take five.
Five? Vials?
No, gallons.
Www-we don't have that much here.
Damint! Give me all you've got, then! [the seminal fluid slides down on his fingers]
[South Park, in town. Butters runs from Dougie, who chases after him]
Aaah! Ah, Ah, Aaah! Nooo! Nooo!
Simpsons did it!! Simpsons did it!! [Butters runs past Tom's Rhinoplasty, but stops to look at the town. It warps into Springfield; Tom's Rhinoplasty becomes Wink-E Mart]
Waaaah! [starts to run again, and the school bus pulls up. Butters hails it down.] Hay! Uh let me on! Let me on! [the door opens and Butters steps on]
[looking like Otto the driver, but still with bird in hair] SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP!!!
[jumps backwards] Haaah! [ends up on his back on the sidewalk as the bus pulls away]
[looking like Smithers] Butters, have you seen Mr. Hat?
[looking like Dr. Hibbert] Hello there, children!
[runs back the other way] Aaah! Nooo! [Chef and Garrison look at each other]
...What the hell's wrong with him?
[Cartman's room, later. Stan looks at the aquarium and sees the civilization has developed further. Pyramids now appear. The sound of running water is in the background. Cut to Kyle filling a larger tank with a water hose.]
Look, the sea people have evolved to an Egyptian-like culture.
Soon they'll discover frozen food. Goh-ho.
[entering] That should be enough water, Kyle. You got the new sea-people packets, Tweek?
Uh-uh huh.
Well, drop them in! [Tweek opens the packets and drops the contents in]
And I've got the sea men. [raises a bowl of semen up to the tank and begins scooping the fluid into the tank.]
Wow. That's a lot of sea men you've got there, Cartman.
Yeah, I bought all that I could at this bank, and then I got the rest from this guy Ralph in an alley.
That's cool.
Yeah, and the sweet thing is, this stupid asshole didn't even charge me money for it. He just made me close my eyes and suck it out of a hose. Heh. [scoops out the last of the semen] There we go. [drops the empty bowl]
[hands Cartman the smaller tank] Okay, now let's put the sea ciety in its new home. [Cartman takes the tank and turns it over, pouring the sea ciety into the larger tank. Screams are heard from the sea people]
Nothin' to do now but wait.[the boys huddle around the new, larger tank.]
...Close your eyes and suck it out of a hose?
Uh-huh, suck it out of a hose, yeah.
Hm.
Huh.
[Cartman's house, next day. He's asleep, but begins to stir. His eyes open and he grins at what he sees. He hops off the bed and rushes to the tank. He looks here and there and finds a more advanced civilization in the tank.]
Oh my God! The tiny underwater civilization has advanced hundreds of years. [grabs his magnifier and looks at the society. It now looks Roman. He begins to speak in wonder] Look! There's a library! A-and a temple! And a- who-? [spots a statue. It's one of him. Hundreds of sea people worship it] Oh. They think I'm God. [throws the magnifier away and rejoices] Yes!!! I am god of the sea people!!! You hear that?! [runs to his window, throws the doors open and screams out] I am god of the sea people!!! I am master of their great sunken empire!!! [his mom opens the door and takes some trash to the trash can next to the driveway] Mo-o-om! I'm god of the sea people!
[returning to the house] That's nice, poopie. [enters and closes the door]
[Butters' house, day. He's sitting in the living room, which now takes the appearance of the Simpson living room]
[shown as Kent Brockman] And in other South Park News, elementary school teacher Ms. Choksondik's [Simpsonized] autopsy has shown that the semen in her stomach belongs to school counselor, Mr. Mackey. [also Simpsonized] However, the semen apparently did NOT contribute to the death, and so Mr. Mackey's identity is to remain anonymous. [Mackey's image becomes a silhouette and a question mark appears over it. Simpsonized Stan and Kyle enter the room.]
Hey Butters.
[spots their altered appearance] Haaa!
Hey, what are you doing, man? Cartman says he has something really cool to show everybody. You've gotta come.
Cartman?
[arrives, shown as Nelson] Ha ha! [Butters is just stunned.]
[Cartman's house, whick now looks like a typical Springfield house, day. In Cartman's room, everyone but Butters is shown Simpsons-style. Present are Chef, Mr. Garrison, Liane, Tweek, Timmy, Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Dougie, and Butters. Cartman displays his new sea ciety]
Behold! You all see my tiny minions groveling at my likeness! I am Eric Cartman, god.
Hey. We paid for the sea people too. How come they're not making statues of us? [Butters looks on with some trepidation]
Be you not jealous, Jew. I am creator of all things, yea.
That is very impressive, Eric. What do you intend to do with your underwater society?
I'm gonna send a message to my people and tell 'em to develop a great machine that will shrink me down to their size, so I can live amongst them forever.
[sensing a chance to retort] Aha! Ahaha! Ahahahaha!
What the hell is wrong with you, Butters?
They did that on the Simpsons! Ha! Treehouse of Horror! Episode 4F02! The Genesis tub. Lisa loses a tooth, and the bacteria on it start to grow, and makes a little society, and they build a statue of her thinking she's God! Ha! Hahaha!
[everyone is silent for a few seconds, then] ...So?
...Yeah. So?
Dude, the Simpsons have done everything already. Who cares?
Yeah, and they've been on the air for like, thirteen years. Of course they've done everything.
Every idea's been done, Butters, even before the Simpsons.
Yeah. In fact, that episode was a rip-off of a Twilight Zone episode.
Really? So I shouldn't care if I come up with an idea, and the Simpsons already did it. It... uh...doesn't... matter. [smiles. Everything before him is back in South Park-style] Everything is back to normal, a, I think... I think I can go back to tryin' to destroy the world again.
Good for you!
Yeah, that's great Butters. Now get the hell out of my room.
[heads for the door] I feel like a spring chicken. I'm ready to wreak havoc once again! [runs out of the room. Dougie stays behind]
Hey, look everybody! The other side of the aquarium is building another statue! [the others turn around to see. Shown is a statue of Tweek in progress]
Hey! It's Tweek.
Me?? Aw, man! I don't wanna be a god. That is waaay too much pressure.
That is bullcrap! You'd better stop worshiping him, sea people! [small explosions are seen and the tank jumps]
What's going on now?
The sea people from Cartman's side are suicide-bombing the buildings on Tweek's side.
Gaaa-hah!
Yeah! Go! [two more explosions are seen]
NOW what's happening?
The sea people on Tweek's side just suicide-bombed the Cartman statue.
Oh God-damnit! [two missiles, one from behind each statue, fly towards the surface and back down towards their respective targets. The impacts both missiles create tear the tank apart and the sea people flood out of the tank. Screams are heard as they fall to the ground]
[stunned, he looks and falls on his knees] Oh no! Oh the humanity!
Well it was a nice project while it lasted, boys.
Yep. But I guess this proves that war is the natural order of life.
Why can't societies just live in peace?
[End of The Simpsons Already Did It]
[South Park Elementary, day, Mrs. Garrison's classroom. Oral Report Day. Token is at the front of the class with a picture of all the planets rising over the moon on the roll-up screen]
Pluto is also the furthest planet from the sun, though scientists believe more planets lie beyond it. I hope you enjoyed my report on the Solar System. Thank you. [the projector turns off and Token takes his seat as Timmy claps a little]
Okay, very nice, Token. Thank you. 'K kids, looks like we only have time for one more speech today, so let's have ah Eric.
[walks up to the front of the class and turns around, looking at his paper] Thank you, Mrs. Garrison. [reads] My speech is entitled "Ginger Kids: Children with red hair, light skin, and freckles." [Stan and Kyle glance at each other] We've all seen them - on the playground, at the store, walking on the streets - they creep us out and make us feel sick to our stomachs. I'm talking of course about... ginger kids. [cues up his pics. A red-headed boy appears] Aww sick! Gross! Ginger kids are born with a disease which causes very light skin, red hair, and freckles. [next picture is of a girl licking her triple-scoop ice-cream cone] Aw, nasty! Yuck! [returns to his paper] This disease is called Gingervitus, and it occurs because ginger kids have no souls.
[annoyed at Cartman's ignorance] What?!
Kids who have gingervitus cannot be cured. [another redheaded girls pops up] Ah sick! [another redhead] Gross! [another redhead] Yeck! [returns to his paper] Because their skin is so light, ginger kids must avoid the sun. Not unlike... [a picture of a vampire with a full moon and bats behind him pops up] vampires.
Aaaah.
That's not true, fatass! I have red hair, and I don't have to avoid the sun!
I was getting to that, if you will let me. [returns to his paper] Some people have red hair, but not light skin and freckles. These people are called "daywalkers." [cues up a picture of Kyle, with "daywalkers" written underneath]
Ho! Daywalkers!
This is all a bunch of crap!
Mrs. Garrison, I'm really havin' a difficult time with all these interruptions...
Kyle, let Eric give his presentation.
It's not a presentation, it's a hate speech! People aren't creeped out by gingers!
[glances around] I am.
Kyle, if you wanna debate Eric, you can do so with your paper tomorrow!
Fine, I will! [crosses his arms]
Fine! In the meantime, shut your Goddamned daywalker mouth! [Kyle grits his teeth and growls, trying to contain himself] Let's see, where was I? Oh yes! Like vampires, the ginger gene is a curse, [next picture: a boy with a few missing front teeth] and unless we work to rid the earth of that curse, the gingers could envelop our lives in blackness for all time. It is time that we all admit to ourselves that gingers are vile and disgusting. In conclusion, I will leave you with this: if you think that the ginger problem is not a serious one, [the last pic is that of Carrot Top] think again. [the bell rings and the kids file out of the classroom.]
Stupid supremacist asswipe!
Dude, what's the big deal?
What's the big deal? Don't you understand what ignorant prejudice like that can lead to? I have to disprove Cartman's hateful rumors! Do you know any red-haired, freckled kids?
[thinks a moment] What about the Foley family? I think they're all ginger.
[South Park, day. Stan and Kyle walk up to a house. The front door opens and three redheads greet them]
Hello?
Hey. Wuh I'm giving a speech tomorrow about people with red hair and freckles. Can I ask you a few questions?
[the middle child] Sure. Come on in. [waves them in. They enter]
[the oldest child] Mom, Dad, these boys wanna know about us.
What? Heh, hello there, kids.
We... came to learn the facts about people with red hair, light skin and freckles.
[nervous throughout] Oho, gingers, yes. Our cute little red-haired rascals.
I'm sorry, but I don't understand. You both have dark hair and brown eyes.
Yes, we've learned that the ginger gene is recessive in both our families' DNA. Actually, the odds of us having a red-haired freckled child were only one in four. And still it happened. Three times. What are the odds? [breaks down and sobs into his hands]
A lot of people carry the ginger gene and don't know. [her husband stops sobbing and raises his head] If your spouse is also a carrier, then your children can turn out like... them. [they both look at the kids, who smile and grin]
Each one of them's a blessing.
Oh yes, each one of them's a blessing.
Huh Blesse-blessing full of love.
[grinning] Thanks, Mom and Dad.
But it's... it's not true they... have no souls. [somber music plays]
No... no, I'm sure they do. [quickly rises and shows the boys to the door] Well it was nice meeting you boys. We've gotta get dinner started.
I just had a couple more questions about-
Look, boys, if you really don't wanna have ginger kids, marry an Asian woman. Asians don't carry the recessive gene. [looks right and left] I know a guy who's marrying a Japanese woman very soon for just that reason. [closes the door on them and they turn around]
[South Park Elementary, day, Mrs. Garrison's classroom. Second Oral Report Day. Kyle stands at the front of the class with an image of melanin's chemical structure]
And so, red hair, light skin, and freckles are all passed down genetically. A child's red hair is not determined by the lack of a soul, [Cartman yawns] but by the melanins which control the pigment in all of our skins. Thank you. [turns off the projector and goes to his desk amid some applause]
Okay, very nice, Kyle. A little dry and science-y for my taste, but there you go. [the bell rings] All right, that's lunch, kids. We'll pick up with Clyde's speech about lesbian cheerleaders after recess.
That was a very informative speech, Kyle.
Thanks Butters
Informative if you want to die. [hops off his seat and joins Butters and Kyle] Gusy, don't forget. Kyle is a daywalker. Daywalkers are half-gingers themselves. Make no mistake: ginger kids are evil. You know who was ginger? Judas. And what did Judas do? Oh, he just got Jesus killed, that's all. [moves towards the door] Look, I'm just saying what everyone else already thinks: Gingers are creepy. And one night, when you're all sleepin' in your room, the gingers are gonna getcha. They're gonna GETCHA! [points at Clyde, who jumps back.]
[South Park Elementary hallway. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny walk towards the camera]
You buying school lunch today?
Nah, my mom packed me a kosher lunch.
[off screen] Right this way! [the camera shows four boys - Craig, Jimmy, Clyde and Token - kicking a redhead out] You can't eat in the cafeteria! [Craig crosses his arms]
How come?
Ginger kids eat in the hallway!
Yeah. Go on, beat it, re... rr-retard! [the redhead walks off and the other four boys go back inside the cafeteria]
There! You see?! This is what happens when Cartman is allowed his right to free speech!
That's just wrong, dude. I wish Cartman could see what it felt like to be ginger.
[thinks] Hey. [snaps his fingers] That's a great idea!
(What's a great idea?)
Can you guys meet me over at Cartman's house tonight at around midnight?
Sure, for what?
We're gonna teach that fat bastard a lesson!
[Cartman's house, midnight. Cartman is snoring. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny pop up outside his window and open it. They climb in. Stan motions Kenny to Cartman's door, and Kenny walks over to close it. Stan quickly goes to Cartman's desk and takes out some makeup - skin bleach, hair color, henna kit - and some yellow latex gloves]
Okay dude, knock him out. [Kyle takes out a small club and starts beating Cartman with it. After five blows Stan rushes over to stop him] Dude, dude okay, he's out! [with the club gone, Kyle resorts to punching Cartman out] Kyle, that's good! [Kenny puts his ear to the door and listens for any activity in the hallway] All right, let's do it.
[Cartman's house, morning. Liane, in her night robe, walks over to Cartman's room and knocks on the door]
Eric honey, time to get up for school. [heads back to the kitchen downstairs. Cartman rolls over and wakes up, hops down and leaves his room]
 -ed a fine time to leave me, Lucille 
Four hungry children and a-

[hears him and drops the spatula] Poopsiekins! [rushes back to the restroom, leaving her eggs cooking. Cartman checks his face thoroughly, but continues to scream. Liane arrives and enters] Sweetie, what is the- [he turns around and she screams] AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
I'M GINGER!
Oh my God! Eric!
Help me! Hellp mee!
[A hospital room. A doctor gives Cartman a check-up]
Well, all his vital signs are still normal. From his outward appearance, I would say he has the standard skin pigment deficiency.
You mean...
Yes, I'm afraid that your son is suffering from gingervitus.
And how could I become a ginger now?! I wasn't born like this!
Well, the red-haired and freckle gene is a recessive gene. It must've stayed dormant in your system until you hit adolescence.
So I'm gonna stay like this forever?
[puts a hand on Cartman's back] I'm sorry, son. [takes Liane aside] Ms. Cartman, could I have a word with you? [walks a few steps with Liane] Ms. Cartman, I know this must be... very difficult for you. I for one can't stand red-haired, freckled kids, but you need to understand, there is no cure. Your son will be ginger his whole life. You might want to just... put him down.
Oh... [looks away. Cartman hops off the bed and walks up and stands between them.]
Agh, excuse me, Doctor, but it just so happens my mom loves me, no matter what I look like! [crosses his arms] Right, Mom?! [a bit shocked when she doesn't answer right away] Mom?!
Oh ye-yes, of course,sweetie.
All right, but... you're gonna have to take certain precautions now. It's very important that you keep Eric out of the sun. The sun... is his worst enemy.
[The school bus stop, morning. Stan, Kyle and Kenny are waiting there, as usual. Cartman walks up with a blue umbrella open, shielding him from the sun]
Hey dudes, what's goin' on? [coughs to clear his throat] How is everything with you guys?
Wow, Cartman. You look... different.
Yes, well, it's interesting you should point that out, Kyle. I went to the doctor yesterday, and apparently I suffer from a small skin pigment deficiency.
You mean,you're a ginger?
Actually, gingervitus is the medical term.
Is that an umbrella you're using?
Yes, Kyle. [coughs] The sun's rays are bad for my skin, so I need to be protected when I'm outside. Well, I'm glad we've gotten all that out of the way, and now we can just go on with our lives as normal.
[looks at Stan for a moment] ...Wow, that's a little ironic, isn't it?
What do you mean, Kyle?
Well, I mean, all last week you were ripping on ginger kids and now you are one.
[thinks] Hm. I don't really see the irony in that, Kyle. [the school bus pulls up and opens its doors. The kids climb in and find seats]
[The school bus. Cartman sits next to Butters, who's taken aback at Cartman's new appearance. A few moments later, Butters begins to laugh]
That's fine, just get it out of the way...
Dude, this is going awesome.
Maybe he'll actually learn a lesson this time. [Butters strokes his nose, then takes out a napkin to wipe away tears from the laughter, then sighs, only to resume laughing, harder. Cartman just folds his arms across his chest and looks away]
[The school cafeteria. The kids are eating, but there's not a redhead to be seen in there... except for]
[Walks up to an empty space between Clyde and Token] Hey Clyde, Token. Sup, Jim? [begins to eat]
What are you doing?
I'm grubbin'. What's it look like?
You're not supposed to be in the cafeteria.
Huh?
You know the rule. No ginger kids in the cafeteria.
But... it's me.
Right. And you're a ginger. [at a nearby table, Stan is about to eat his burger, but Kyle softly jabs him]
Dude, check it out. [Stan looks over]
Guys! Okay, look, maybe I'm ginger, but... I'm not like other ginger kids. I'm still me inside. [the camera looks around at the other kids at the table, who remain silent]
Sorry. If we let one ginger kid in here, then the others are gonna start coming.
Yeah, beat it, j... jackass. [Cartman is stunned, but takes his tray and walks away. He walks past Kyle, Stan, and Kenny.]
We did it guys. We finally taught Cartman a lesson. I'll bet that now, Cartman is gonna have a long hard think about how he treated gingers.
[The South Park Elementary Library. Cartman did indeed think long and hard about this, so now he's holding this meeting.]
I want to thank everyone for showing up today. I've called this meeting because, I don't know about you, but for one am sick and tired of being discriminated against! Just because we have red hair, light skin and freckles, we're thought of as somehow less important, and it's bullcrap!
Yeah!
Kids at school laugh at us, doctors call us "genetically inferior." The world needs to know that we are people, with feelings! And our parents love us for who we are!
My dad says that each one of my freckles is a kiss from an angel.
...Riiight, exactly! We can't let this go on any longer! We should be PROUD of who we are! Think about all the great people in history who were ginger. People like... [he can't think of any] Like uh... [looks up in thought, then softly] Liiike...
Ron Howard?
Right! Ron Howard! And uh... Aaaaand...
Ron Howard? [the other redheads look at him]
Right! We already had him, but right! See? Ginger people go on to do amazing things in society! We need to let everyone in this school know that we are not inferior! That we are in fact beautiful, totally awesome, and super-smart. It's time for us to take back our pride!
Yeah!
[The playground, moments later. A girl chases a boy around. Stan, Kyle and Kenny play tetherball]
Red Power! [Stan stops the game and the boys look at the source of commotion. Cartman leads the gingers across the playground]
Red Power!
Red Power!
Red Power!
Red Power!
Red Power!
Red Power!
Red Power!
We gingers are proud people! We are the noble descendants of great Americans like Ron Howard, and ...others! We will not be discriminated against any longer, for we are a great race!
Yeah!
[resumes the march] Red Power!
Red Power!
Red Power!
Red Power!
I don't believe it.
Red Power!
Should we tell him the truth?
Red Power!
Nah, let him make a complete ass out of himself for a little while longer. [he and Stan return to their tetherball game]
Red Power!
Red Power!
Better red than dead!
Better red than dead!
Better red than dead!
[New break. A field reporter stands outside a theater, with a crowd milling around behind him]
Tom, I'm standing outside the Denver Center For The Performing Arts, where the new production of "Annie" has just premiered to cries of outrage. [a shot of gingers with Cartman front and center] A rapidly-growing organization called The Ginger Separatist Movement is furious that the lead role of Annie [shown, in character] is being played by a girl [shown in regular clothes and real hair] who isn't actually red-haired and freckled. Joining me now is the gingers' head spokesperson, Eric Cartman.
That's right! This is bullcrap! We True Gingers are furious that the role of Annie is being minimalized!
What harm do you believe this actress is doing to the true red-haired community?
The bitch isn't ginger! She's just using makeup to look ginger! And pretending to be ginger with makeup is the worst thing anybody can do!
Yeah! That's right! [among other things]
[The center's doors open and Annie walks out to cheers and flash bulbs. She waves to everyone]
There she is! Get her! [the gingers rush her and start ganging up on her] Die, you stupid bitch!
This is getting pretty ugly, Tom. These gingers are really riled up! If you are a ginger and would like to join The Ginger Separatist Movement, you can attend their first meeting this Friday in the Sunset Room at the Airport Hilton.
[The Airport Hilton, day, the Sunset Room. One of the older boys in school is speaking]
Okay, welcome, everyone. It's so great to see such a wonderful turnout at the first All-Ginger Pride Conference! [everyone cheers] Now it is my honor to introduce the man who has brought self-respect to gingers, Eric Cartman!
[comes in pumped up like a televangelist to his own theme music] Thanks Jody! Gingers, how are we feelin'? [the redhead cheer] Can I get a Red Power?
Red Power!
Oh yeah! That feels good, doesn't it? Feels good to be proud of who you are! Now I don't think I need to tell you there's a lot of hate out there. Hate for awesome people like us. And if there's one thing I've learned, is that the only way to fight hate, is with more hate! We are not the freaks of society, everyone else is!
Yeah!!
Gingers are the chosen people! The chosen race! And we must view the rest of the world as the lowlife, dark-skinned rats that they are! [all the redheads cheer wildly]
Hello there! Gary Nelson with Hilton Guest Relations. Just making sure you guys have everything you need. [long silence]
We're fine, thanks.
Need any buffet items restocked? Everyone okay on coffee?
We're fine!
Great. Oh, and hey guys, just wanted to say thanks for choosing the Airport Hilton for your conference.
You're welcome!! Now leave us alone!! [Gary closes the door] My fellow gingers! I envision a world in which there IS no hate! A world where everyone is ginger! And so, we must gather together every child who is NOT ginger, and exterminate them!
Huh
What
Ex-terminate?
Now go! Go out into the night and take non-ginger kids from their homes! We will eradicate them all with cages and tortures and a pit of lava to thrown them all in! Now I am not gonna live my life as a Goddamned minority! Are you with me?!
Wirha! atta!
[Night time. Kyle and Kenny knock on Stan's front door, and he answers. He rubs his eyes and remains half-asleep]
Dude, we're gonna go sneak into Cartman's and change him back into a non-ginger!
Huh? Why?
Because now he's acting like gingers are awesome. And all his friends are gingers. When he wakes up tomorrow and realizes he isn't really ginger, it'll be hysterical!
(Hehe, yeah. Hehe)
Are you in?
... totally.
[The sidewalk. The three boys walk towards Cartman's house]
You know, Cartman is an uncaring, bigoted intolerant asshole, but I have to admit, I had my own prejudice about gingers. I think we all need to realize that everyone is different in one way or another, and we shouldn't be threatened by those differences. I mean, Cartman had me kind of creeped out that gingers were gonna come get me in the night.
(Hehe, yeah, heh) [Stan stops and gasps. The other two stop. Before them stand at least five redheads]
Oh... hey there. [long silence]
You guys... need... anything? [long silence]
Let's just... let's just walk this way. [starts to cross the street, Stan and Kenny follow him, but they all see more gingers crawl out of the bushes across the street]
More ginger kids. Um, meh-maybe we should just go home.
Yeah, good idea. [the boys go back the way the came. Gingers converge upon them, and they begin to run]
The hell do they want? [A redhead comes in from the right side and snatches Kenny away]
(AH!)
Kenny!
Run, dude, run!!
[Clyde's room, night. Clyde is sleeping, but some noise wakes him up. Three raps are heard on the window and he sits up to see who it is]
[gathers his covers around him] Uh... Gi... ginger kids! AAAAAH! [his parents leave their room]
Clyde? What is it, honey? [they go to his room and open his door, and are horrified. Before them is his window, wiiide open, and his empty bed. The wind howls outside]
[Another house, night. A boy goes to his bathroom to brush his teeth. He pulls the toothpaste out of the medicine cabinet and closes the door, only to find some smiling gingers waiting for him]
Aaah! [turns around] Ginger kids! Nooo! [a ginger girl grabs a hold of him]
[Another house. A boy opens the front door and his little sister stands behind him]
Laaa la, laaa lala.
What is it?
laaa lala.
It's a... little ginger girl.
laaa la.
Shut the door!
Laaa la, laaa lala, laaa la.
AAAAAH! [they panic and run away. The boy runs into the banister and falls down. The girl trips over him]
Ow!
[reaches the entrance] Laaa la, laaa lala.
[Another house. A boy is showering before he goes to bed. He rinses off, closes the faucet, opens the curtain, and screams. He cowers in the bathtub as gingers close in on him]
[The sidewalk. Two kids are walking alone when more redheads appear and converge on them]
[An abandoned barn.]
In there! Let's go! [he and Stan run into it and close the doors. They run to a long log and lift it up] Get this jamb on the door! [they throw the jamb into place. Redheads try to wrestle the roads open but can't budge it. A window nearby breaks open and gingers start to crawl in through it. More windows break open, then the walls and doors start falling apart as the gingers barge in. Another ginger looks in from the roof and drops down to join the others. They grab Stan and Kyle, who scream one last time]
[The Airport Hilton, day, the Sunset Room. Stan, Kyle, and a few non-ginger kids are in a cage]
Kyle. Kyle, wake up.
[wakes up] Huh. Whaaa? [stands up] Where are we? [walks to the cage wall and looks out. The Sunset Room is dark and red from the glow of a lava cauldron. There are cages all over the place, even hanging from the ceiling. The ginger kids stand around the cauldron]
I think we're at the Sunset Room at the Airport Hilton.
My fellow gingers! The day of reckoning is finally upon us! [the gingers stomp and cheer]
Cartman?
Oh Jesus, I should have known!
What we begin here, we will take worldwide, until the blood of every non-ginger child has been spilled! [more stomping and cheering]
You guys got everything you need in here? Need more coffee, buffet items?
No, we're fine! Thank you!
How about lava? You got enough lava?
Yes! We're good!
Okay. Hey, thanks for choosin' the Airport Hilton, guys.
You're welcome, now leave us alone!! [Gary leaves and closes the door] Now! Let the extermination begin! [more stomping and cheering] We will start... with the daywalker!
Daywalker! [The cage door opens and Kyle, handcuffed, is hauled out by two redheads and escorted to Cartman] Throw him in!
Cartman! I need to tell you something!
Go on then! Say your last words!
Aah I think you'd rather hear this in private!
Okay fine, let him speak! [the redheads let Kyle go, and Kyle falls on his face] Then we kill every non-ginger here! [Kyle gets up, walks over to Cartman, and whispers in his ear. Cartman's anger vanishes, then surprise appears] You... you what? [Kyle repeats himself. Cartman looks around a bit fearfully, then touches his face all over and grits his teeth]
Come on, let's fulfill the plan! All non-gingers must die!
Yeah!
[now hesitant] Right, the plan. Um... Oh. Oh, my God, you guys! Uh, I just realized something. [backpedals] We shouldn't be doing this. Ah I mean, look at us. [throws away his staff] What have we become?
Huh? What?
D-don't you see? If we go and exterminate everyone who isn't ginger, then we're no better than they were for thinking less of us. Maybe we all have to learn to live... together.
But... you just said everyone who isn't ginger must die.
Right, but... but I've learned that we can't judge people based on what they look like.
But you just said they should all die fifteen seconds ago.
See I know, I know, but I I get it now. We we've got to live and let live. [the gingers look at him, stunned]
[long beat, then] What did that kid in the green hat tell you?
... Huh?
That kid right there. What did he just tell you?
Ss. Who? Oh him? Oh. No, that was just... Tha-that was about something else, totally unrelated.
You wanted to kill everyone who wasn't ginger, then that kid in the green hat told you something, and now you don't wanna do it all of a sudden. What did he tell you?

No, he was just telling me about something funny that happened at school yesterday. Um, oh, but anyway, ohhh! Oh wow, I can't believe how great it feels to finally love my fellow man, huh? Isn't this great you guys? We sure have been throgh a lot! But in the end, we all learned it's best to get along.
Hand in hand, we can live together. Ginger or not, we're all the same.
Black or white, brown or red, we shouldn't kill each other, 'cause it's lame. Come on, guys!
Hand in hand, we can live together.


[unsure] Ginger or not, it's all the same.
That's it! You've got it!
Black or white, brown or red, we shouldn't kill each other, 'cause dying's lame. 
Hand in hand, we can live together.

Live together!
We shouldn't kill each other 'cause we're all the same.
The same, you and I!
Black or white, brown or red, we shouldn't kill each other, 'cause dying's lame.
You are such a manipulative asshole, Cartman.
Yes, but I'm not going to die. [steps forth] That's why we gotta get along, people!
Hand in hand, we can live together. We shouldn't kill each other 'cause we're all the same.
[End of Ginger Kids.]

[as credits roll]
Black or white, brown or red, we shouldn't kill each other, 'cause dying's lame.
Hand in hand, we can live together. We shouldn't kill each other 'cause we're all the same.
Black or white, brown or red, we shouldn't kill each other, 'cause dying's lame.
Hand in hand, we can live together. We shouldn't kill each other 'cause we're all the same.


[Stan's house, day. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are in the living room playing video games.]
HA! I killed you!
HA, I blew your head off!
(Aw, Goddamnit!)
Jesus, is Cartman still in the bathroom?
Hey Cartman! We're almost to level 20! You giving birth in there, or what?
Let a man take a crap!
Dude, he's in there punishing my toilet.
Hyeah, that poor, poor thing
Come on, Cartman! You're missing the game!
[from behind the bathroom door] I'm almost done, you smartasses! I'm just wipin' mah- whoa, what the hell is that? [finishes wiping his butt and zips himself up. He comes out of the bathroom with something in his hands] You guys, look what I found in the trashcan in Stan's bathroom. It's like a bloody cotton thing wrapped in toilet paper.
Well, why did you pull it out of the trash?
Because I thought it was a jelly doughnut, but look, check it out, it's all bloody.
[walks in with a basket of laundry] Are you guys still playing that video game?
Yeah. Hey Mom, Cartman found a bloody cotton thing in the bathroom.
[holds it up] Look. [Sharon gasps and drops the laundry. Cartman unravels it] But I don't think it's for usin', I think it's just for lookin' through. [looks through it]
Eric, put that down!
Why?
Just go put it back in the trashcan!
[inspects it] Hey, it's like all bloody. It might be alive.
No that... that came from me; just put it away.
This came out of you?? You just left it in the trashcan?! [hick accent] You shouldn'ta done that. He's just a boih. Poor little feller.
[looks up at his mom] What is it, Mom?
Yeah, what it is, Mrs. Marsh?
Boys, that a... feminine thing. Alright, it's a personal, woman thing. [game play stops and the boys look at her] I tell you what: If you'll just drop the whole thing right now, I'll buy you that new video game console you've been wanting.
The 2001 Okama GameSphere?
Sure.
Cool!
Wow, this is like finding trashcan gold, you guiys!
[Luau's Toys, day, later. A banner reading "WE HAVE GAMESPHERE" hangs over the window, and the console itself is in the window display.]
There it is. The Okama GameSphere. [the game console is shown, along with two controllers and several boxes containing the console]
Dude, it's got a hundred twenty eight gigahertz D-RAM.
What's that?
Don't know, but it kicks ass. [they watch as Sharon buys the console from Mr. Harris and he wraps it up and delivers it to her] Wow, dude, you're the luckiest kid in South Park.
Hey, this is all of ours. I'm the one who found Stan's aborted brother in the trashcan and blackmailed his mom into getting the GameSphere. [the boys turn away from the window]
Alright, alright, but you guys gotta see if you can sleep over for the rest of the weekend. [checks his watch.] It's Saturday at 2:30 - that means we have... 39 hours to play GameSphere until school on Monday!
(Woohoo!)
Awesome! [suddenly remembers] Oh, crap.
What?
I'm supposed to go to the lake with my family tomorrow and swim and play in the stupid sun.
Dude, we got GameSphere.
I know, I know. Well, look: I'll stay over anyway so I can play for... eighteen hours, and then I'll go to the lake. [a strange character walks up next to them]
Don't forget to bring a towel. [it's a walking, talking towel]
What?
When you get out of the water you need to dry off right away to avoid catchin' a cold. That's why Towelie says, "Don't forget to bring a towel."
...O-kay.
Thanks, Towelie.
[after a few moments of silence] Do you wanna get high?
No. [Towelie looks for a few moments, then walks away]
Anyway, that will give me plenty of time playing video games.
Kyle, I think you underestimate Okama GameSphere.
Here you go, boys. [Stan takes the shopping box and the boys take off]
AAAAAA.
[Stan's house, later. In the living room, Kyle finishes connecting the GameSphere to the back of the TV]
Okay, turn it on.
"Okama GameSphere"!
Whoa!
[the game title comes up] Thirst For BLOOD!
Oh yeah, Thirst for Blood. Bring it.
Oh, this is so cool.
Bring it, bring it! [on the TV two monsters fight each other. The one on the right attacks the other with a chainsaw. "Oh!"]
[Stan's house, night. The boys have been playing for hours. Around them are empty boxes of Cheesy Poofs and cans of Zoop soda. On the sofa is a bag of chips. Stan's parents walk up to the boys.]
Goodnight, boys. Don't stay up too late.
G'night Mom, thanks for GameSphere.
[slowly slides into a hick accent] Yeah, but you still shouldn'ta done that. 'E's just a boih.
What?
Nothing. Come on, Randy. [whisks him off to bed. From the TV: "Twenty kills."]
[Stan's house, Sunday morning, dawn. The boys have stayed up all night playing video games. Kyle is on the phone with his parents.]
Yeahyeah, Mom. I-I can't go to the lake. No, S-stan's having emotional problems and I need to help see him through it. He's got- [to Cartman] wha-what is it?
Date-rape psychosis.
Date-rape something. Yeah. Okay. I will. Okay, thanks, Mon. [hangs up] I don't have to go outside!
Awesome!
She said it's fine, but that I still have to go to baseball practice tonight..
Oh, yeah, we got baseball practice today. God damnit!
We shouldn't have this many responsibilities! We're children!
Well, it's alright. We can still play for [looks at his watch] six more hours, and then we'll go play baseball.
[walks in from nowhere] Don't forget to bring a towel.
Uh no.
When you're playin' sports, the sweat can get in your face. That's why Towelie says, "Always keep an extra towel in your duffel bag."
Okay, we will.
[raises its arms in victory] Alright! [lowers them, then after some moments] Do you wanna get high?
No we don't wanna get high!
Okay... You sure?
Yes! Go away, you stupid towel! [Towelie goes away]
Oh, dude! Did you see that? I cut off your face and ate it!
That's... so... cool!
[Stan's house, later... The boys have repositioned themselves and look half-asleep from all the game play. Doughnuts and ice cream appear - a cone is on the rug with its ice cream melting. Sharon walks up to them again.]
Okay, boys, that's it. You have to go now.
No no, it's okay, Mom. We c-we can't go to baseball practice 'cause Kyle has cancer.
No, Stanley, it's Monday morning. You have to go to school.
It's Monday?
Oh, uh, I'm sick.
Me too.
No, you're not sick. Now get to school. [disconnects the console from the TV] All of you.
But Mom...
Go!
Aagh!
[Bus stop, moments later. The boys are now waiting for the bus.]
Can't believe we have to go to school!
Yeah, real life is so boring and stupid.
We just have to try and make the day go as fast as possible so we can get back to GameSphere. [a green car pulls up in front of them. Two soldiers are in it]
Hello, boys, how are you?
Fine.
Say, boys, this may sound a little ...odd, but... have you see a ...talking ...towel around anywhere.
What? You mean Towelie? [the two soldier look alarmed. The passenger quickly gets on the radio]
Echo, this is Garrett. I've got a code 5 at... [checks his map] Park County, Colorado! Repeat! Code 5, Park County, Colorado! [the men look at the boys]
What, dude? [the driver steps on the gas and the car peels away. The passenger soldier looks out the window and back at the boys.]
This is gonna be one looong-ass day. [Ms. Crabtree pulls up and the boys get on the bus.]
[Stan's house, Monday afternoon. The boys arrive there from the bus stop]
That was the longest day of school ever!
Come on, hurry. I bet we can get to level 29! [the boys burst in and head for the television]
[Stan's house, living room. The boys stand in from of the television]
Where is it?
It... it was right here.
Where the hell is it??
Come on, man, this isn't funny! [Kenny, Kyle, and Cartman look around and behind the TV] I need my fix! [the phone rings, and Stan goes to answer it.]
Hello?
If you ever wanna see your Okama GameSphere again, you will bring us the towel. [the boys gather to wait for Stan]
What? Who-who is this?
Just get the towel and meet us at the gas station outside of town. Or else! [in the background: "Okama GameSphere!"]
Don't hurt it! [Click. Stan then hangs up]
What? [Stan turns around]
They've taken it. They've taken our Okama GameSphere.
[in disbelief, backs up.] No! ...No!
Uh-uh-uh what do you mean "they've taken it"? Oh, this isn't happening! This isn't happening!!
[South Park, sunset. The boys walk down Main Street.]
Towelie!
Hey, towel!
Where the hell is he?
(I don't know. Where could it be?)
I don't know. They guy on the phone thought we had Towelie, so now we gotta find him.
What has this world come to? Where people can just... take your Okama GameSphere.
Hey maybe we'd better do a towel call. [the others stop, and he calls out in one direction] Gebaayybeh! [then in another] Gebaayybeh!
That's a towel call?
This is hopeless. We're never gonna find him.
Hey, wait a minute. Towelie always showed up to give us towel advice when we'd said something about water.
Hey yeah. [goes into the street and clears his throat] Well guys, let's go to the swimming pool! [looks around. So do the others] Aaah. Let's go take a shower! [all look around] Let's go waterskiing!
[walks up] Don't forget to bring a towel.
There he is!
Be sure to bring a towel so you don't get aaall wet. [Stan walks over angrily and takes Towelie's left hand, and pulls him along].
Come on, dude! [the others follow]
Where are we goin'?
Just come on! It's getting dark.
Are we gonna get high?
[Outskirts of South Park, night. A full moon shines down on the boys as they reach the gas station]
Are you sure this is where they said to be?
They said the gas station outside of town.
Well, I'm gonna get a little high. [A high-powered light comes on]
Hold it! [ten men stand in the light. Some of them wear red berets]
Who is that? [squints his eyes and blocks the light. Towelie does the same]
Step... away... from the towel! [the boys do so, and an official steps forth]
There you are, towel. We've been looking all over for you.
If you ever go to a hotel, be sure to bring your own towel.
It isn't safe for you out here, towel. There are people out here to mean to harm you.
'Scuse me, can we have our Okama GameSphere back? We just wanna play video games.
Your what?
Agh! Look, dude, we're on level 24, about to cross into the Caverns of Madness!
I don't know what you're talking about.
You called us and said if we brought the towel you'd give us our video game back.
Omigod! [shrieks] IT"S A TRAP!! [gunfire strikes him and kills him. Behind the boys soldiers pop up in the hills and continue firing]
Cover! Cover! [the officials and their personal security force fire back, and the light is knocked out]
Goddamnit, what now?!
Run, towel! [a grenade lands between two guards and blows up, shredding them to bits. The boys just look on]
[disinterested] Agh. Come on, they've gotta have our video game around here somewhere. [leads the others away]
Where's the towel?!
It can't be far! [two more soldiers come up, and others move along behind them] Alvarez, you and Mitchell sweep left!
[coughs up blood. The boys arrive] Hurry! You must get the towel back to Tynacorp!
[grabs the guard by the lapels and throttles him] Where is our Okama GameSphere?
Get the towel home [cough] They will explain everything. Please, hurry! [coughs up blood once more, and dies]
Aw, God-damnit!
Do you know where he's talking about, Towelie?
What? Oh yeah, back at the base. It's a long ways away.
Alright, we're gonna have to use this truck. Come on, guys. [they go for the truck. From a distance in a woods nearby, a commander looks at the troop movements]
Well?
They've gone, sir. It's like they've vanished out of thin air.
Damnit! I knew those boys were protecting that towel. [gets pensive] They must have some unexplainable bond with it.
Perhaps they're telepathically linked to the towel, sir, like E.T. [the commander looks at him annoyed, and he leaves]
It could already be anywhere, hiding out again. No, the time for being nice is over. We must instigate... Plan B.
You mean...?
Yes. [camera zooms in] Destroy all towels within a thousand mile radius. [fade to black]
[A desert, later that night. The truck rolls along... Stan steers, Kyle, Towelie, and Cartman ride along. Kenny mans the pedals]
Are we getting close?
I think so.
A little more gas, Kenny. [Kenny presses down on the gas pedal]
How long has it been since you've been back there.
I've been wanderin' around on my own for the past few weeks. You know, helpin' people out with towel safety and proper towel use. It's important.
No it isn't.
Is!
No it isn't.
Is! Wait, turn down here. It's down this dirt road.
Brake, Kenny, brake. [Kenny brakes, and Stan steers the truck to the right to go down the dirt road. Towelie moves to the window]
Egh!
M-maybe it's down that dirt road.
[sighs] Dude, don't you remember where it is?
I can't remember, it all looks the same. Hold on, let me get high. [pulls out a joint...] then I'll remember where it is. [lights the joint and puffs deeply. The boys watch him as his eyes get bloodshot.]
Alright, so where is it?
Where's what?
Agh!
The base where you're from and where our Okama GameSphere is! [Towelie simply snorts]
Alright, that does it! Brake angrily, Kenny! [Kenny brakes angrily and the truck jerks to a stop] Now listen, Towelie, we've just about had it with you!
Well calm down.
That's it! [takes the joint] You're not getting high again until we have our Okama GameSphere back!
That's my last joint, asshole!
I don't care! You'd better remember where your base is!
Oh man, why is everyone riding me today? God-damnit.
[A purple house, night. Inside, in the restroom, a woman washes her hands and face, then pulls a towel out of its rack to dry herself]
Kevin? Don't forget to wrap the potato salad in aluminum foil. [some strange sounds are heard outside the door] Kevin, is that you?
Harris! Reach bang and clear!
Hello? [the bathroom door flies open and five soldiers pour in, firing away] WAAH! [she falls to the ground quick] Ohmigod! Oh no! Ohmigod! [she covers her head]
Alright, it's clear! It's clear! [the soldiers leave the restroom. The woman gets up and checks herself for bullet wounds and finds none. She turns to see the wall behind her. The towels on their rack are shot through with holes. She blinks, confused]
[a backyard. Mrs. Tweak pulls down some clothes she's had drying on clotheslines. As she nears the towels, three soldiers rush in and start firing away at them]
HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!! [Mrs. Tweak leans out of the way, watching her towels get shot up.]
Let's go let's go! [The soldiers finish their job and walk away. Mrs. Tweak straightens up]
[A men's gym shower, night. Mr. Garrison is in the shower with two other men. He finishes and wraps a white towel with blue stripes around his waist, then walks towards his locker]
Get it!
What the? [two soldiers rush over and make him face the lockers. One of them pulls off his towel]
Throw it down! [the soldier throws it down]
Oh alright, have your way with me if you must! Go on, fulfill you sick pleasures! [the soldier stabs at the towel twice, then directs another soldier to fire away at it. The other soldier shoots at it while the other two watch]
Alright, let's go! [the soldiers leave]
Huh where are you goin'?
[The truck the boys are driving pulls up in front of a gleaming glass building with "TYNACORP" above the entrance, and the boys pour out with Towelie]
This is where you came from?
Yeah, I think so. [gets woozy] Oh man.
What?
I'm so high right now. I have no idea what's goin' on. [the group goes around the fountain and goes inside]
[Tynacorp, inside. The boys walk down a long passageway]
Welcome home, Smart Towel RG-400.
Ah hi, is this where our Okama GameSphere is?
We're missing out on some quality video game time right now.
Thank you for bringing him to us, boys. You see, this is not an ordinary towel. He is the RG-400 Smart Towel, designed with a computer chip inside the terry cloth
We don't care.
You see, here at Tynacorp, our goal was to make the perfect towel. A towel that would sense how wet or dry the user's skin was and fluff itself accordingly.
Dude, we don't care.
Towelie was our greatest success. Smart enough to beat the average human at chess and absorbent enough to soak up even the toughest spills. But then one day, Towelie got high and just sort of wandered off.
We... don't... care.
All we wanna know is, who has our Okama GameSphere?
Ah yes, your video game. I'm afraid that what we all experienced was a trap. They called you and said to bring the towel, and then they called us and said they were bringing Towelie back. Their plan was to wipe us all out with one fell swoop.
Who's they?
Why, the military. You see, after Towelie got high and wandered off from here, the military got a hold of him. They wanted to turn Towelie into a weapon of mass destruction.
[dismissive] Don't care, don't care, don't care.
Towelie was at their base for months as they tried to copy his TNA. But then, one day, Towelie got high and just sort of wandered off. Again.
Goddamnit! Can we please... just get back to playing our video game, PLEASE?!
I'm afraid not. Because your Okama GameSphere is at "their" base.
Can you tell us where "that" is, please?
You mean to go right into their base? [thinks] Of course. The entry code should still be in Towelie's memory banks. You could sneak him in there and recover his TNA. Great plan.
[Secret Government Base, night. Inside, various military officials man a command center. Two soldiers walk up to the commander and salute him]
Sir! Sergeant Masters and Boll are reporting, sir!
Ah yes. [salutes back, and all three men lower their arms] Tell me, Marine, did you accomplish your primary goal?
Sir yes sir! All towels have been destroyed! The Smart Towel is no doubt eliminated.
Ahh. And you're... quite sure of this. [the two sergeants look at each other]
Eh yes sir, there isn't a towel left within a hundred miles.
Hmm... [taps his pointer on the strategic map] So perhaps, then, you can explain to me why we just got footage of the towel returning to Tynacorp?!
Oo we...
He must have outsmarted us, sir.
Well I'm through playing hide and seek! We've got no other choice! Prepare to blow up all of Colorado!
[The night sky. Clouds float by overhead, past the full moon. A helicopter flies into the sky and the camera follows it. Two officials prepare the boys for dives into the military base as the research leader talks]
In a moment we will be over the base. This is the only way in. Any attempts on the ground would be easily spotted by guard posts.
Okay.
[rolls up to Towelie] I hate to send you back in there, Towelie, but only you have their security system in your memory banks.
That's alright. It's always good to bring a towel.
Good luck, boys. The fate of the world is depending on you.
We're not doing it for the world, we're doing it for our video game. God, are you deaf?
Alright, boys. When you drop from the plane, cover and roll. Got it?
Yeah. [the boys join Towelie and all go to jump from the helicopter]
Go go go go! [one after the other, the four boys and Towelie jump off, and then the helicopter leaves. Stan is the first to pull his parachute string, and the others follow. Soon they're all next to each other, floating down. Stan sighs]
Dude, I figured it out.
What?
If we can go in, and get the GameSphere in 30 minutes, we could still be back at your house playing video games by midnight!
So that'd be, like what, eight hours we could play before school?
Seven and a half.
[getting impatient] Hurry up, stupid parachute!
[Secret Government Base, night. The boys land silently and start walking]
Alright, I think we go over there. [the Secret Government Base entrance is shown with Towelie and the boys approaching the gate]
[at the security entry pad] Let's see. [types in some numbers] No. [touches his lips with his right index finger, trying to figure out what to type next]
Come on, Towelie! The guy said you have the security system in your memory banks.
Hey it's been a long time!
You just have no long-term memory 'cause you get high all the time!
[faces Cartman] Don't preach to me, fatso!
I can preach to you all I want, 'cause you're stupid!
You're stupid!
Yeah, and you're a towel!
You're a towel! [Cartman has nothing more to say, and Towelie hops off the box towards the boys] Just let me get high. I know I can remember if I get high.
Oh, God damnit! Alright, fine! [gives Towelie the joint] Here's your stupid lighter. [tosses Towelie the lighter, and Towelie lights up. The bloodshot eyes return.]
Hold on. [hops on the box and types into the entry pad again.] Wait a second [presses a few buttons] That's it!
That's it?
Yeah. That's the melody to "Funky Town." [starts playing the melody on the keypad] Won't ya take me down... to Funky Town.
No, Towelie, the entry code!
[turns around] For what?
God-damnit, I guess we're gonna have to climb the stupid fence.
[Secret Government Base, night, inside. The boys climb over the fence and sneak past a soldier without arousing suspicion. They end up at the genetic research building]
Well let's look in here. [opens the door and leads the others in. Before them are cylinders of liquids, each with a floating deformed clone of Towelie in it. They come across a Towelie clone drying under a heat lamp]
Kill... me... Kill... me.
Oh my God! No-o-o-o!
[enters with four soldiers, who quickly get set to fire] Well well well. Look what the cat dragged in.
[turns around with the boys] What are these things?
Genetic copies we tried to make with your TNA. They didn't work too well, I'm afraid.
Kill... me.
Do you have our Okama GameSphere?
You did very well to get the towel this far, boys. I wonder: What did they tell you at Tynacorp? That the big, bad government wanted to genetically engineer a Towelie as a weapon? Now let me tell you the real story.
Oh God, don't care, don't care.
[pacing proudly, solemnly] Yes, we've been trying to make our own genetic copies of the towel, but only because we had to. You see, when we started spying on Tynacorp, we discovered a certain, terrifying secret. [the boys show no interest.]
Go on! Ask him what terrifying secret.
What terrifying secret?
That Tynacorp was making these towels to take over the world!
We're never gonna play our Okama GameSphere again, are we?
Don't you see what genetically enhanced smart towels like these are capable of? You get out of the shower and dry yourself off. But even after you're dry, the towel makes you more dry. It keeps getting you drier and drier. [his voice begins to deepen] Can you imagine it? What it would feel like to be way, way too dry? I'll tell you something: You don't want to know. And I don't know.
And we don't care.
You've been double-crossed by Tynacorp, kids. They set this all up to get you in here and take us down.
So let me get this straight: Our Okama GameSphere is back at Tynacorp.
Oh yes. It has been all along.
Can I kill the towel now, sir?
Go ahead. [the boys move away quickly]
No, wait. [stays the weapon] Perhaps now, we can use their own towel against them. These boys must return to Tynacorp, and we will launch a sneak attack on Tynacorp as well. [zoom in on a tiny camera close to Towelie's lower border. Officials back at Tynacorp's command center are looking at the live feed] You boys can take the towel to Tynacorp's central core, and upload this encryption disk into their system, bringing them down once and for all.
But we don't care!
[Tynacorp command center. The officials gather around the research leader]
What the hell is this?! The towel was supposed to go in there and then run its own self-destruct sequence!
The towel has a will of its own. It's... learning compassion.
We don't have the manpower to hold off the entire military AND stop those wonderboys from getting to the core!
Then we have no choice. We'll have to test the new prototype a little... earlier. [presses a button. A door with "GS-401" on it slowly spins around. A towel rack appears and a mean-looking buff towel hangs from it]
[deep voice] Don't forget to bring a towel!
[Tynacorp, outside. Shadows appear in the brush across the way. The commander is there with his troops, the boys, and Towelie]
Alright, boys, take the towel back in there and say your mission was accomplished. [hands a disk to Stan] Then upload this encryption disk into their computers.
We're just going in to get our video game back.
If anything goes wrong, use this newly-developed photon rifle. [hands it to Kyle]
Photon rifle, whatever. [the boys enter Tynacorp with Towelie.]
[Tynacorp command center. The boys walk through the center slowly]
Hello? Hello, anybody here? [GS-401 hops down from the rafters]
Welcome to the party, boys! [flexes and rushes Towelie] HAAARRRHHHH!! [the two towels wrestle a bit]
Oooh. Ooohh! Oh boy.
HAAARRRHHHH!! [Kyle fires the photon rifle and knocks the beefier towel away with the beam. The research team and security force pour into the room angrily]
So, you thought you could outsmart us, did you kids?
[he and his troops pour in another door] Aaaaarrrr. Move move move move move move! [the two forces face each other, with the boys and Towelie in the middle] Don't make a move, you bastards!
Bring the towel here, boys. They can't shoot children.
Don't listen to them. They lied to you before.
Oh yes, boys. Obey your government! Well perhaps it's time these boys knew what was really gong on!
Ohmigod, look! [in front of a monitor connected to a long table is the Okama GameSphere the boys had been wanting to get back. The boys rush to it]
Our GameSphere! [the boys each get a controller and activate the GameSphere: "Okama GameSphere"]
Aw, sweet, it still saved our plays. [behind him, Towelie exits screen left as the two forces face each other. The boys quickly get lost in the game play]
[turns to look at the boys] You see boys, I'm afraid you were double-crossed. If they were the military, why wouldn't they just attack us to begin with? Because they're not the military!
Alright, maybe we lied to you, but it was to protect your own skin! We are a resistance group pretending to be the military to bring Tynacorp down!
Whoa, check it out, guys, the parachute level.
Sweet!
[now facing the research leader] But perhaps we should show these kids who Tynacorp really is made up of. Go on! Tell them why you've been making towels! Zytar! [pulls at the research leader's head and the face comes off. Under it a green fish-alien head appears]
Oh, there's gold. Get the gold, Kenny!
Our planet was dying! We had no choice but to find a new one! Manufacturing Smart Towels was our way to spy on humans to see how they lived.
[looks at the boys] And now you know the horrible truth, boys.
Truth or no, your alien-murdering group is over! [fires a gun at the commander. Both sides begin to fire at each other and there are casualties on both sides. Zytar and two guards slowly back away and out of view]
Could you turn it up?
Boys, try to reach the core override! We've got no choice but to try to take them all out! [the boys continue playing their game, so the commander comes up and reaches for the encryption disk in Stan's pocket, then goes away. Towelie sits on the floor with a huge bong, getting high. The commander reappears across the room moving towards a red button] I think I can get it from here, boys!
[returns] What are you doing? You'll kill us all!
Sorry, Zytar. Didn't your mom ever tell you? Don't mess with earthlings. [inserts the disk and a huge explosion blows the boys out of the room.]
Oooww! [Then it blows out the roof and some sides of the main building, and the boys find themselves hanging from Towelie, above a boiling tank of acid]
Hup hup. Come on, hang on. [Stan and Kyle moan]
Whoa.
(Help help! Heeelllppp!) [loses his grip on Kyle]
Kenny!
(Nooo!) [falls into the acid tank, disintegrating and sinking. Kyle looks on, but next to him is the GameSphere]
[sees it] Oh my God! Our GameSphere! You've gotta move me closer! [above him, Stan watches large pieces of metal fall to the ground]
Hurry up, Kyle! This place is coming apart! [Kyle swings ever closer to the GameSphere]
[walks in on an adjacent catwalk and sees Towelie with the boys hanging] What are you doing?
Get away from me, you evil towel!
Towelie, listen to me. Let them go. Drop them.
No way! They're my friends!
They aren't your friends! Humans have ruined the planet, killed off their own environment! Their time is over. It is the towels' turn now.
[swings closer] I've almost got it!
You're going to let them go, Towelie! Because... I know your weakness. [holds out a joint. Towelie looks at it longingly] Here. You can reach it. Come on, Towelie! How long has it been since you've had a nice burn, huh?! Twenty, thirty seconds?!
[feels Towelie slip] Aw, crap!
You're going to have to choose between their lives, and, getting high.
You asshole.
Towelie, don't let go of us, you God-damned towel! Kyle's almost there!
Come, Towelie! Make your decision!
I-I-I choose... I-I-I choose... both! [Stan is shocked at the answer. Towelie stretches enough to take a puff while holding on to the boys, then slips enough for Kyle to succeed]
I got it! [grabs the GameSphere. Towelie pulls himself and the boys up to the catwalk in front of a door. An explosion behind GS-401 sends it into the air]
Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! [floats down into the acid and disintegrates]
Come on, guys. Let's go play video games!
Alright!
Hooray!
[Stan's house, night. The boys are gathered before the TV playing their Okama GameSphere with a new player: Towelie.]
Oh, dude, we finished level 50!
Awesome!
Oh, man, I have no idea what's goin' on.
Check it out: Now we're going into the secret underground base.
Alright, guys, focus. Looks like this is gonna be an underwater level.
[heavily slurred] Don't forget to bring a towel. [the boys laugh]
You're the worst character ever, Towelie.
I know.
[End of Towelie.]
[South Park]
Previously, on South Park: an air of sobriety fills the laboratory as the men of South Park gather to find out which one of them fathered this boy. [Cartman chowing on cookies and milk]
Who is Eric Cartman's father? At the end of this episode, you will know the answer.
[Opening warning and theme song. Much has been added. Then the episode resumes at the laboratory]
And now, to continue, the father is indeed someone in this room.
Man, this feels like the longest minute of my life.
[Kenny is restored to the story line. Kyle notices] Oooh- hey, Kenny.
Gentlemen, the father is... [the lights go out]
Hey, what the hell's going on?
It's a power outage!
[Two gunshots, then a body is heard falling. The lights go back on and the men settle down]
Is everybody okay? That sounded like a gunshot!
Oh my God, look! [Mephesto lies shot on the floor, his ass-headed cane next to him]
(Oh my God, they killed Mephesto!)
You bastards!
Mephesto's been shot. [everyone gathers round Mephesto]
Is he ...dead?
[with Ned by a broken window] Hey! This window is shot out, too! That means the killer was not someone in this room!
Then who was it?
Who shot Mephesto? Was it the school counselor? Or was it Ms. Crabtree? Or was it--
Ey! Wait a minute! I didn't find out who my father was!
Or was it Sheila Broflovski?
[listening to Mephesto's chest] Waait! [getting up] He's still breathin'! He's not dead.
[grabbing Mephesto's shirt] Goddammit! Who's my father?
[about to lift Mephesto] We've got to get him to the hospital.
You've got to be kidding me!
Come on, children! [carries Mephesto out the door. Cartman follows]
Eeeehh..!
Oh, that poor kid. It must be hell for him going through all this. [Ms. Cartman sighs deeply and moves away]
There's a murderer free in South Park. We have to find out who it is before they kill again.
Yeah. God only knows who they'll kill next.
Who will they kill next? Will it be Jimbo? Barbrady? The Denver Broncos?
[Chef is driving up a hill with the kids and Mephesto on the first night of this episode]
Is he awake yet?
[checking] He's bleeding pretty bad back here.
Don't let him bleed on my Meredith Baxter-Birney memorial towel.
What's a Meredith Baxter-Birney memorial towel?
I actually was with Meredith Baxter-Birney in this very car. And afterwards we used that towel to... [mad at himself] Wait a minute. Why am I telling you this?
Could you pull over so I can get out?
What? We have to get to the hospital.
I have to get out first. I'm not gonna make it; I can't stand hospitals.
Sorry, Stan. We just gotta drop Mephesto off and then we can get outta there, alright?
Man, it's really starting to snow. [outside view of snow falling as Chef drives by] I hope they don't close the roads.
They can't. Mephesto can't die.
Maybe it's better you don't know who your father is, Cartman.
No way, dude! I can't stand to leave things unfinished. It's like when you hear the first part of that song, "Come Sail Away", by Styx. If I hear the first part of that song, I have to finish it.
Really?
Yeah, du-I can't do anything until it's done.
[looks at Stan, who looks back. He starts] I'm sailing away
No! Don't!
Set an open course for the virgin sea...

[tries to resist, but the pull is just too strong] Eh-- [two short gasps follow, then he races through...]
For I've got to be free
Free to face the life that's ahead of me
On board I'm the captain, so climb aboard
We'll search for tomorrow, on every shore
And I'll try, oh lord, I'll try to carry on
Maymaynemay Maymaynemay Maymaynemay Maymaynemay
A gathering of angels appeared above my head
They sang to us this song of hope
And this is what they said
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me
[The car passes a sign for Hell's Pass Hospital]
I thought that they were angels, but to my surprise
We climbed about their starship and headed for the skies
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads
[heavy panting. Chef keeps driving]


Whoa, dude!
[City Hall, first night. Sheila, Officer Barbrady, Sharon, and Jimbo are assembled before the Mayor]
What are we gonna do, Mayor? This killer is on the loose!
We can't even leave our homes for fear of our children's safety.
Uh... Where are our children? [they look around]
Officer Barbrady, let's pretend for one second that we had a competent law enforcer in this town: what would he do?
Hmmm... That's a good question, Mayor. Let me get right on that with thinking.
[rushing in with cameraman amd boom mike operator] Mayor! Mayor!
[aside to an aide] The press is here.
My name is Sid Greenfield. I'm the director from Los Angeles for America's Most Wanted.
[amazed] Youuu certainly made it up here quickly.
We're desperate for stories. [boom mike operator thumps him] A-and this one is so compelling.
[aroused] Really??
Sure. This story has everything. People. Furniture. Talking-ih it's a real American story.
Hey, I thought of something. [close-up] Uh... no, wait, that's subtraction.
Mr. Director person, what exactly do you want to do?
Mayor, shouldn't we be focusi--
Shh.
We just want to do a recreation of the story for our show. Then we'll flash a number on the screen that people can call if they have any information regarding the identity or location of the shooter. That's it. You win, we win, America wins.
Are you sure this wouldn't make our little town look dangerous?
Don't worry, Mayor. America's Most Wanted is not about violence, it's about family.
It is?
[thoughtfully] Weelll, in that case, I guess it's okay! [gung-ho]
Great! We'll get started with auditions immediately. What part should we cast first?
Who will the director cast first? Will it be Mr. Garrison? Officer Barbrady? Chef?
[Unplanned Parenthood Clinic. It is snowing on this first day.]
I want to have... an abortion.
Uoh well, we can do that. This must be a very difficult time for you, Mrs...
Cartman. Yesuh- it's such a hard decision, but I just don't feel I can raise a child in this screwy world.
Yes, Ms. Cartman. If you don't feel fit to raise a child, then abortion probably is the answer. Do you know the actual time of conception?
About eight years ago.
[processing] ...I sseee, so the fetus is...
Eight years old.
Ms. Cartman, uh- eight years old is a little late to be considering abortion.
Really?
Yes, this is what we would refer to as the "fortieth trimester".
But I just don't think I'm a fit mother.
Wuh... But we prefer to abort babies a little- ...earlier on; in fact, there's a law against abortions after the second trimester.
Well, I think you need to keep your laws off of my body.
Hmmmmm. Tsk, I'm afraid I can't help you, Ms. Cartman. If you want to change the law, you'll have to speak with your congressman.
[rises from the chair] Well, that's exactly what I intend to do. Good day! [exits]
[Hell's Pass Hospital, the second night]
[reaches the hospital and gets out quickly] Come on, children! We've gotta find a doctor! [Kenny follows him in]
[stops] Ugh. I can't do it, dude. [Kyle and Cartman pass him]
Come on, Stan. Hospitals aren't all that bad.
Yeah, stop being a wuss!
[Operating room. A patient lies on the table, and the doctor is being assisted by a female nurse with no arms below the elbow. Chef and the kids enter]
Doctor!
One moment, please. Nurse, I need 20 cc's of sodium pentathol, stat! [she reaches for the syringe and grabs it with her mouth]
Whoa, dude! She doesn't have any arms!
We're an equal-opportunity employer here, son. [she spits out the syringe, and he catches it along the cartridge end]
Doctor! We've got a shot cracker outside!
I'll be right with you, right after I inject this man with a long needle.
[pained] Oh man. [grabs his stomach] I'm gonna be sick.
There there, young man. Medical science is nothing to be afraid of. [squeezes out any air left in the syringe. A few drops escape, and he rams the needle into the man's side]
Oogh.
[scraping sounds are now heard] Ooooo, I think you're hitting the bone.
Ooooogh.
[still driving the syringe] Yes. I can hear the needle scraping against the bone inside. [blood bursts from the injection site] Oops, he's hemorrhaging. [a burst lands next to Stan]
[wide-eyed] Aghh!
[plop] Ooo! His head fell off.
I'm gotta get outta here!
Stan!
Ugh, some people just have a weak stomach.
[The second day. America's Most Wanted temporary set]
[Greenfield is accompanied by his assistant in the auditorium]
And the father of Eric Cartman is... Bang! Oh, Jiminy! I've been shot! [drops the cane]
Oh, thank you very much. We'll get back to you. [the actor departs] I think I've seen enough genetic engineers. Let's move on to the auditions for the part of Misteruhh Garrison.
Call the Mr. Garrison auditions!
Boy, I sure hope I'm not Eric Cartman's father, Mr. Hat.
[just a sock with two purple disks for eyes] You can say that again, Mr. Garrison!
Alright, not bad. Let's keep him on the top pile. Next!
I sure hope that I'm not Eric Cartman's father, Mr. Hat.
You can say that again, Mr. Garrison!
Thank you! Next!
[shocked] What?
 Next! [Mr. Garrison leaves, dejected, as another actor enters]
[an actor with a deep voice] I sure hope that I'm not Eric Cartman's father, Mr. Hat.
[a fist with a face drawn on it] You can say that again, Mr. Garrison.
Perfect! You got it! Let's move on to the Chefs! [Mr. Garrison stands dumbstruck]
[Same day. Liane is in bed with her congressman]
...And so you see, Congressman O'Reilly, that's why I think abortion laws should be changed.
Well, all I know is that third-trimester abortions are illegal. I don't really know anything about 40th.
But the person at Unplanned Parenthood said you were who I had to talk to about changing the law.
No- No, I think youah gotta talk to the governor about that stuff.
Oh, dear.
[The third night. Back at the hospital.]
[Mephesto is on the operating table, sedated] Well, this is about all I can do for him.
Can't you get him to talk? I have to know who my father is.
Sorry, son, it might be a while.
[bounding onto Mephesto and slapping him around] Wake up, you son of a bitch!
Whoa!
[as he lowers Cartman to te ground] Now, son, that's not's gonna do him any good. I'll let you know if there's a change in his condition.
I can't wait anymore. What am I supposed to do?
Hey, Cartman.
What?
I'm sailing ay...

--way; Set an open course for the virgin sea
For I've got to be free, free to face the life that's ahead of me
On board I'm the captain, so climb aboard...


Okay okay, let's get outta here now! [...We'll search for tomorrow on every shore...]
[looking out at the snow storm] I don't know if that's gonna be too easy. [...And I'll try, oh lord, I'll try to carry on...]
My God, that's a hell of a storm. [I look to the sea; Reflections--]
[--in the waves spark my memory...] Oh, weak. [Kenny looks up towards the window.]

...Some happy, some sad; I think of childhood friends and the dreams we had
We lived happily forever, so the--


[The third day. Back at the studio, auditions have ended]
[looking at the storm] God, I hate mountains. [moving to the center of the studio] This better not push back our shooting schedule. [Actors for Mephesto, Barbrady, and Chef are on the laboratory stage. Greenfield takes the megaphone] Okay, people, let's rehearse the reenactment from the top before we shoot it. [sees a new actor and turns to his assistant] Who's that?
Oh, that's TV's Eric Roberts. We were able to ge him to play the part of the little monkey guy.
Whoa. Talk about "all washed-up", huh? Great to have you, Eric! [he stops munching a doughnut long enough to wave and smile] Here we go, aaand action.
I want to announce who the father is.
Bang!!
Oh, I've been shot! [falls over]
Nobody move! I'm a law officer!
My God, I think he's gone into cardiac arrest!
[as Chef Actor speaks] Whoaw..!
You seem somewhat unnerved by this, Chef.
Are you accusing me, Barbrady? Because if you are accusing me, don't hide behind your clever riddles!
Our differences must be set aside for now, Mr. Chef. I'm simply a man, a man trying to do my job.
Whoa, this is a good movie!
[Same day, back at the hospital]

Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me-hee
[the boys are in the emergency room with a bunch of patients bleeding, getting nauseous, etc.]


Ohh. Dude, when can we get out of here?
[the doctor bursts through the emergency doors with the nurse]
[bleeding from a gash on the neck] Doctor, I can't focus!
We're doing the best we can, ma'am. They've closed the pass and none of the other doctors can get through. For now, it's just me, and Nurse Goodly. [she tosses the stethoscope around for a better hold]
Wait a second. They've closed the pass??
Yes, I'm afraid we're critically understaffed. Unless we get help soon, all these people in here are completely fucked. [everyone turns to him and gasps. He quickly retracts] Metaphorically speaking, that is.
What about Mephesto? Are you taking care of him?
He's on full life-support and breathing fine. He shouldn't need any help - so long as the power doesn't go out. [Bzht. Everything goes black] Oof. Who didn't see that coming a mile away, huh?
[The fourth night. Show time! A siren rotates, there's a hold-up and a helicopter zooms in on a raid from above. There's also a ground shot of the arrest. Lady Justice appears. A suspect is thrown behind bars]
Tonight, on America's Most Wanted, a shooter is on the loose in Colorado, and its residents are up in arms! Here's your hose, John Walsh.
Good evening and welcome to America's Most Wanted. Tonight: terror invaded the small mountain community of South Park, Colorado, when Dr. Alphonse Mephesto [his picture appears] was gunned down in his laboratory. America's Most Wanted has reconstructued this heinous crime [the South Park Genetic Engineering Ranch is seen] in hopes that your calls could help solve the case. [A reenactment plays:]
[Pfff. The actors flinch and he throws away the cane] I've been shot!
[catches him] My God, Mr. Hat! Get some help!
Right away, Mr. Garrison.
No, no! My lifetime partner and friend, gone, taken away in the wink of an eye. O, Fortune, why do you mock me?
What the--? Bu-eh. Eric Roberts is improvising lines again!
I'm going to get the man to a hospital. Who will help me?
This is not a world I want to live in! Doesn't anyone want--
God-dammit! [outside, a pine tree falls on the studio's power lines. The lights dim and all action comes to a halt] What the hell is this?!
We've lost the feed to L.A.
Uuuhm... We-we seem to have lost our linkup to the South Park crew, sso I guess we'll be going to our featured movie, Who Framed Roger Rabbit.
Who framed Roger Rabbit? Was it Jimbo? Mr. Garrison? Chef?
Somebody go see why we lost the hookup! [the doors fly open and snow is swept in]
Holy smokes, that blizzard is getting crazy!
[The fourth day, back at the hospital. Lights can be seen in most of the rooms. Inside, the backup generator has come online and everyone is running around]
Don't panic, anybody. The power lines are down, but the backup generator is running just fine.
[opening the operating room doors wide] Nurse, I could use some help in here!
Coming! [finds Cartman in her way]
[halting her] Lady-m? Is Mephesto gonna be okay?
Yes, for now. But I'm afraid the generator won't run for long. The batteries run out in half an hour. Time is very short.
Nurse, please! I need another pair of hands in here! [she looks at him and glares] Oh, sorry.
[Same day. Liane at the Governor's mansion, in bed with him]
Don't you see, Governor? I should have a right to have an abortion if I want one.
[smoking] Mmaarr. I don't know-uh, I might need some more convincing, hm-hm-hm. [edges closer to her]
I mean, what right do I have bringing another child into this overpopulated world? Then again, I should've thought of that before having sex. then againuh-- Oh, I just don't know...
[Back at the hospital.]
Please, Mr. Chef. I've over 100 people to attend to an-and only myself and Nurse Goodly.
What do you want me to do?
Do you know anything about surgery?
I used to watch Quincy.
What?! Why the hell didn't you say so? Put on some scrubs! Boys, I'm making you all honorary doctors. You can help us save these people's lives.
No way, dude!
[America's Most Wanted studio, in the dark, the fifth night]
[opens the door and a pile of snow pours in on him] Well, [opens his right eye] we're not going anywhere for a loong time.
We're snowed in?
Yes. We're trapped!
[snuggling up to Greenfield] Like sailors on a submarine.
My God, this is the worst storm I've ever seen.
Oh I have to get out of here, I haven't eaten since breakfast.
Yeah, I'm gettin' hungry, too. [rubs his belly]
I hope you all realize what we might be facing here. [all are attentive] Our only option might be to... eat each other to stay alive. [Gasps are heard all around]
Uuuhh, it's only been like, four hours. Aren't you resorting to cannibalism a little quickly?
That's a lot of lead, Mr. Director. I don't eat pretty, but if a few of us must die so the rest can stay alive, so be it.
Buut, how do we decide "who"?
Well, we draw straws.
Now, wait a minute. We all had a big breakfast: can't you people go without eating for a little while?
Calm down, soldier! We need every person here to keep his head! Barbrady, fetch some straws.
Well- who the hell made you the boss anyway?
Who the hell made Jimbo boss? Was it Barbrady? Chef? Mr. Gar--
[Same night, the hospital. The doctor is operating with his motley crew. Stan and Kyle are on one side, Cartman and Kenny are on the other. Chef stands at one end of the table between Cartman and Kyle, and the doctor is at the other end.]
Miles' appendix has burst. I have no choice but to operate now with our limited power. I need you all to be strong for me. [Stan raises his brows] Nurse Goodly will take care of the anesthesia. Chef, you act as her arms. [he withdraws] Boys, you have to help with suction and bandages. Ready?
No.
Okay. First, I'll make an incision on the chest, over the heart.
[queasily] Oh boy. [the doctor slices the flesh vertically over the X he has marked over the heart. It splits open and Stan removes his mask] Bleech! [the vomit goes right into the open incision]
Duhuhude! You barfed into the incision!
Sweet.
Suction! [Kenny places the suction cup over the incision. The power begins to flicker, and he removes the cup]
Hey, who's screwing with the lights?
Who is screwing with the lights? Is it Barbrady? Or Jimbo? Or the 1991 Denver Broncos?
[to Kenny] That is really starting to piss me off.
[America's Most Wanted studio, nighttime. Barbrady stands holding the straws]
Alright. So far, everybody has a long piece of straw. We'll keep drawing. [draws] Whew.
[draws] Whew.
[sees that his straw is short and throws it away, behind himself] Wooo!
Wait a minute! Where the hell is the short one?
The short what?
Dammit, Barbrady! When you draw straws, you're supposed to have one of them short! That's how you decide who loses!
That's not how I played it!
Uuugh, could we hurry this up? My stomach is growling.
[back at the hospital]
I found a map that shows the location of a backup generator. Apparently, they built a large self-sustaining generator- for just this kind of emergency. But it's out and away from the hospital.
So how do we get to it?
We must split up into two teams: Team A, and Team B. Team A will consist of myself, Stan, Kyle, Eric, Chef, and Nurse Goodly. Team B will consist of Kenny. [Kenny is stunned. The doctor pats his head] Now, listen closely, Team B. Your goal will be to turn on the backup generator. To do this you must brave the storm outside and get into this sewage duct. [points it out to him on the map] Meanwhile, Team A will go to the holding area, here [points to it] where there is a television, and some cocoa. We will drink the cocoa and watch family programming until Team B makes it through the sewage duct. By that time, Team B- remember, that's you, Kenny- should reach the outer core of the generator. It will be a cold and dangerous climb to the top, and there could be velociraptors- here. [points to an area between the holding area and the generator] Once you reach the top, you should be able to get a clear view from this windows of us drinking cocoa and watching television. Then, you could proceed down into the generator, and power it on. Are there any questions?
Nnoh, that sounds pretty sweet to me.
Great, then, let's do it. Go, Team!
(Huh?)
[the studio]
I... can't... go on... eh. So... hungry...
We're all going to die in this horrible place. [covers her eyes]
We have to have the energy to make it through the night. We have to eat.
How can we? How could we live with ourselves?
There's only one answer: eat Eric Roberts. [He's shown squatting on the floor]
[thoughtfully] Yes, of course. Nobody gives a shit about Eric Roberts.
[madly] Eat Eric Roberts! [the rest of the group goes mad, Ned gets up and everyone prepares to do him in]
No! No, please!
[Later. Eric's arms, legs, and head have been removed, and bees hover around the corpse]
Well, there's no going back now. [Ned and Jimbo keep eating] We're cannibals. [someone burps] God save us.
God wants you to live, Mayor. Fight! [presumably, to God]
[Coolly] Well I have to admit, Eric Roberts was much juicier than I expected.
[miffed] Aaww.
This snow just isn't letting up. We're gonna die here, I know it.
What time is it, Barbrady?
It's almost midnight.
Oh! I can't... go on. [drops to his side]
We'll give the storm another hour. After that, we might have to eat again.
What? Christ, are you people diabetic or something?
[the hospital. Kenny has made it through the tunnel and exits the manhole. He's pretty soiled. He turns on his communicator]
Team B? Come in, Team B.
(This is Team B.)
Listen, Team B. We've found another path to the generator. There's actually a nice heated walkway to it, so you don't need to walk through all that sewage.
(Are you fuckin' telling me that I could've fuckin' gone that way?!)
Oh... Well, forget I said that, then. Listen, Team B, you should be seeing a large drift of snow with some metal sticking out of it just to your left.
(Yup! I see it in the drift.)
Good. Head towards it. Team A out.
What if Mephesto never wakes up, and I never find out who my father is?
[Kenny heads toward the generator and a dinosaur casts its shadow on both of them]
[The studio. Ned, Jimbo and the Mayor are eating again. The camera shows that Greenfield and the assistant have joined Eric Roberts as casualties to cannibalism. Barbrady is seen working on a leg and some ribs]
My God, what a harrowing tale of human drama this is. All of us doing what we must to survive.
It is amazing what people can do under stress. Just look at the pyramids. Nobody knows how they built those, or who.
Who built the pyramids? Was it the Babylonians? Officer Barbrady? Samaritans?
[The generator. Kenny has opened the door and is ready for new orders.]
(Okay, I've reached the generator)
Roger, Team B. [to the rest of Team A] He's reached the backup generator. [to Kenny] Team B, can you see the two copper nodes?
(Roger.)
Good. Now, is there a wire connecting them?
(Negative.)
Damn! The wire connecting the nodes is gone! We need to complete the circuit between them, or we're screwed.
D'you have any wire here?
There's no time! Once these lights flicker out all the patients on life-support are going to die!
(I'll stick 'em together)
No, Kenny, you can't. There must be some other way! He's going to make the connection himself, with his hands.
No, he'll die!
Go, Kenny!
Kenny! Nnnoooooo!
(Goodbbyyyyee-ugh!)
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
You bastard! [the lights stabilize]
The power! [Kenny's sacrificial act has worked!]
Quickly! Get the scanner running again! [the scanner is brought in] We've got a chance now!
[The fifth day, the White House. Liane has bedded her way up to the President, and she's in bed with him now.]
Well, okay, Mrs. Cartman, I'll legalize 40th trimester abortions for you.
[relieved and joyful] Oh, thank you, thank you.
We'll have the pregnancy terminated immediately. [Her eyes widen]
[pulls back] Terminated?
Why yes, that's what an abortion is.
Oh no uh- I didn't mean that. I meant the other thing you can do-what's that other A word?
Adoption?
Yess, that's what I mean. Adoption.
Well, that's- pretty different.
Oh, I should tell my son the truth about everything myself. Good day, Mr. President. [quickly leaves the bed]
[The fifth day. Colorado sunrise]
Well, we made it. The power is on, the snow is melting, and your friend Mephesto is doing fine.
[just now coming to] Where... where am I?
You're at the hospital, Mr. Mephesto. You were shot. Now, we don't know who tried to shoot you, but--
Ohh. I'm sure it was my brother again. He tries to shoot me every month.
Ooohhh.
Where's the little fat boy? He'll be delighted that Mephesto's awake.
He went off looking for Mr. Kenny.
[Outside, Stan, Kyle, and Cartman are at the generator. I guess the raptors have left.]
He was a good friend, and I'll miss him.
He was very brave. He risked his life so that Mephesto could live.
Yeah. And now he's a freezy-pop. [Kenny is shown iced over, and the boys simply stare]
[to Kyle] Dude! D'you think if we hit him with a shovel, he'd shatter?
I don't know. Let's find out.
["Ave Maria" begins to play. Jimbo is the first to shovel his way out of the studio. Garrison follows, then Ned, then the Mayor, then...]
Ohh. It's over! We're free!
Yes, but at what cost, Mr. Garrison? At what cost?
Listen, everybody. We did what we had to in there.
But- hhhow will we live with ourselves now?
Mm-one day at a time, Mayor. Mm-one day at a time.
[A la Aaron Neville] Ave Maria... [the camera pulls back, and back...]
Well, I'm bringing home some Eric Roberts in a doggie bag. Does anybody else want some?
[the hospital. Mephesto is recuperating, and Kevin is back at his side. All the possible fathers are present, including the Denver Broncos]
I'm glad that you could all come. I can finally reveal who the father of Eric Cartman is. But first, I want to thank Kenny McCormick for sacrificing his life--
Just tell us already!
Alright alright. The father of Eric Cartman is... Say, did anybody see that Terrance and Phillip special last month? Wasn't that just the funniest thing--
[boiling] Dammit! Tell me who my father is already!
Oh. As I said before, the father is somebody in this room. The father is... Mrs. Cartman. [all gasp]
What???
[back with her cookies] Yes, it's true.
Noo, that doesn't make sense!
Yes. It took quite a while for me to understand as well. You see, Mrs. Cartman is a hermaphrodite. [she looks guilty]
Uh-meaning what?
Meaning that she has both male and female genitals.
It's true.
You mean, at the Drunken Barn Dance, when we all got together with her, she was a he?!
No no, not exactly. But she did have a penis. [Ned, Barbrady, and Chef vomit. The rest just cup their mouths. Gerald is shocked] The fact of the matter is, hermaphrodites cannot bear children, so Mrs. Cartman's DNA match with Eric can only mean that she is his father, and she got another woman pregnant at the Drunken Barn Dance.
Ugh. Man, this is fuckin' weak.
Dude! You're a big fatass, and your mom's a hermapholite!
I'm sorry I never told you, Eric. [Eric and Stan look up at her] I just thought, maybe it would be a little shocking to you.
Oh, wow, gee whiz, you think so, Mom?!
Well, that's that. Thank you all for playing.
No no, wait a minute! If... if she's my dad, then... who's my mom?!
Who is Eric Cartman's mother? Is it Mrs. Crabtree? Sheila Broflovski? The Mayor?
Ooohhh, forget it! [Stan moves off]
[End of Cartman's Mom is Still a Dirty Slut.]
